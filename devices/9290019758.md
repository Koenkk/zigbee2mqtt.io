## Notes


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../configuration/device_specific_configuration.md)*


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.


### Motion sensitivity
The motion sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_ID]/set` one
of the following values: `low`,  `medium`,  `high` (default).


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possbile with the following configuration:
