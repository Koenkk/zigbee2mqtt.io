# Device

| Model | L1529  |
| Vendor  | IKEA  |
| Description | FLOALT LED light panel, dimmable, white spectrum (60x60 cm) |
| Supports | on/off, brightness, color temperature |
| Picture | ![../images/devices/L1529.jpg](../images/devices/L1529.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npxOrPxVfe0)).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

While pairing, keep the bulb close the the CC2531 USB sniffer.

What works is to use (very) short “on’s” and a little bit longer “off’s”.
Start with bulb on, then off, and then 6 “on’s”, where you kill the light as soon as the bulb shows signs of turning on.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possbile with the following configuration:

    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
