# Home Assistant

*NOTE 1: This file has been generated, do not edit this file manually!*

use their documentation*


## MQTT discovery
**At least Home Assistant >= 0.84 is required!**

**NOTE:** Groups are not auto-discovered, see configuration below.

The easiest way to integrate Zigbee2mqtt with Home Assistant is by
using [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
This allows Zigbee2mqtt to automatically add devices to Home Assistant.

To achieve the best possible integration (including MQTT discovery):
- In your **Zigbee2mqtt** `configuration.yaml` set `homeassistant: true`
- In your **Home Assistant** `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
mqtt:
  discovery: true
  broker: [YOUR MQTT BROKER]  # Remove if you want to use builtin-in MQTT broker
  birth_message:
    topic: 'hass/status'
    payload: 'online'
  will_message:
    topic: 'hass/status'
    payload: 'offline'
```

Mind you that if you want to use the embedded broker of Home Assistant you
have to [follow this guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker#embedded-broker).

Zigbee2mqtt is expecting Home Assistant to send it's birth/will
messages to `hass/status`. Be sure to add this to your `configuration.yaml` if you want
Zigbee2mqtt to resend the cached values when Home Assistant restarts

## Home Assistant device registry
When using Home Assistant MQTT discovery, Zigbee2mqtt integrates
with the [Home Assistant device registry](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/device_registry_index.html).
This allows you to change the Home Assistant `device_id` and `friendly_name` from the web interface
without having to restart Home Assistant. It also makes it possible to show which entities belong to which device.

![Changing name and device ID via web interface](../images/home_assistant_change_name.png)

![Device registry](../images/home_assistant_device_registry.png)

## I'm confused about the different device IDs, names and friendly names
- Home Assistant `device_id`: determined on first discovery of the device, can only be changed
via the Home Assistant web interface afterwards. Used to control/read the state from the device (e.g. in automations)
- Zigbee2mqtt `friendly_name`: used to change the MQTT topic where the device listens and publishes to.
- Home Assistant `name`: name shown in the Home Assistant UI (unless overridden
via a `friendly_name` in `customize.yaml`). If not changed via the Home Assistant web interface,
it is equal to the Zigbee2mqtt `friendly_name`. Is updated if the Zigbee2mqtt `friendly_name` changes
(requires restart of Home Assistant)
- Home Assistant `friendly_name` (`customize.yaml`): overrides the name in the Home Assistant web interface.

## Responding to button clicks
To respond to button clicks (e.g. WXKG01LM) you can use one of the following two Home Assistant configurations.

### Via MQTT

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button clicks
    trigger:
      platform: mqtt
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME'
    condition:
      condition: template
      value_template: '{{ "single" == trigger.payload_json.click }}'
    action:
      entity_id: light.bedroom
      service: light.toggle
```
{% endraw %}

### Via Home Assistant entity
Due to a [limitation in Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/20716),
this automation can only trigger 1 time per 1 or 2 seconds.
If you need this, use the MQTT trigger from the example above.

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button click
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.my_switch_click
      to: 'single'
    action:
      entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
      service: light.toggle
```
{% endraw %}

## Groups
Groups are not auto-discovered. Use the following configuration:

{% raw %}

```yaml
- platform: mqtt
  schema: json
  name: MY_GROUP
  command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/[GROUP_FRIENDLY_NAME]/set"
  state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/[GROUP_FRIENDLY_NAME]"

  // Modify according to features supported by all devices in group
  color_temp: true
  brightness: true
  rgb: true
```

{% endraw %}

## Controlling Zigbee2mqtt via Home Assistant
The following Home Assistant configuration allows you to control Zigbee2mqtt from Home Assistant.

{% raw %}
```yaml
