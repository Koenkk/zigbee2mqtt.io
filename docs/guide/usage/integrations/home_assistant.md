# Home Assistant

## MQTT discovery

The easiest way to integrate Zigbee2MQTT with Home Assistant is by
using [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt#mqtt-discovery).
This allows Zigbee2MQTT to automatically add devices to Home Assistant.

To achieve the best possible integration (including MQTT discovery):

- In your **Zigbee2MQTT** `configuration.yaml` set:

    ```yaml
    homeassistant:
        enabled: true
    ```

- Enable the [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) in Home Assistant

## Device/group page

Since Home Assistant 2021.11 the device/group page in Home Assistant can directly link to the frontend (_Visit device_ button).
To enable this set the `url` in the [frontend](../../configuration/frontend.md) configuration.

## Home Assistant device registry

When using Home Assistant MQTT discovery, Zigbee2MQTT integrates
with the [Home Assistant device registry](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/device_registry_index.html).
This allows you to change the Home Assistant `entity_id` and `friendly_name` from the Home Assistant web interface
without having to restart Home Assistant. It also makes it possible to show which entities belong to which device.

## Customizing discovery

The device specific configuration allows you to modify the discovery payload. Here you can also prevent a device from being discovered. See [Device specific configuration](../../configuration/devices-groups.html#specific-device-options) for the available options.

## Responding to button actions

To respond to button actions you can use one of the following Home Assistant configurations.

### Via MQTT device trigger (recommended)

The [MQTT device triggers](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/) are discovered by Zigbee2MQTT **once the event is triggered on the device at least once**.

```yaml
automation:
    - alias: Respond to button click
      triggers:
          - trigger: device
            domain: mqtt
            device_id: ad44cabee4c646f493814306aa6446e1
            type: action
            subtype: arrow_left_click
      actions:
          - action: light.toggle
            target:
                entity_id: light.bedroom
```

### Via Home Assistant `event` entity (experimental)

Note: `event` entity is **experimental** and may **break** in the future.

This method work by responding to the state change of an [`event` entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/event). The specific event can be targeted via the `event_type` attribute. Until the implementation becomes finalized, the event types and additional attributes are subject to change and you have to enable `event` entities explicitly by setting `homeassistant: {experimental_event_entities: true}` (see [Configuration](../../configuration/homeassistant.md) for more info).

```yaml
automation:
    - alias: Respond to button click
      triggers:
          - trigger: state
            entity_id: event.my_switch_click
            to: ~
      conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{trigger.from_state.state != 'unavailable'}}"
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{trigger.to_state.attributes.event_type == 'single'}}"
      actions:
          - action: light.toggle
            target:
                entity_id: light.bedroom
```

### Via Home Assistant action sensor (deprecated)

This method works by responding to the state change event of a sensor. For this `homeassistant.legacy_action_sensor: true` needs to be set in your `configuration.yaml`. See the [docs](../../configuration/homeassistant.md) for more info.

::: warning
Note that this feature is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It's recommended to use the MQTT device trigger instead.
:::

```yaml
automation:
    - alias: Respond to button action
      trigger:
          platform: state
          entity_id: sensor.my_switch_action
          to: 'single'
      action:
          entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
          service: light.toggle
```

## Groups

Groups discovery is supported for groups of lights, switches, locks and covers. For other types you have to manually create a config in the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`.

## Overriding discovery properties

Any Home Assistant MQTT discovery property can be overridden on a device. Two examples are shown below. For a full and current list of discovery properties, see [the Home Assistant MQTT Discovery integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) and [the Home Assistant extension](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/blob/03ba647dc6b5f299f8f3ab441712999fcb3a253e/lib/extension/homeassistant.ts) in the Zigbee2MQTT source code.

### Changing `supported_color_modes`

This is useful for switching light bulbs from reporting values from X/Y (which is the default) to reporting in hue / saturation (which is what bulbs report color in when changing via hue or saturation, such as with the `hue_move` and `saturation_move` commands).

This example changes a [light's `supported_color_modes` discovery property](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/#supported_color_modes) to hue / saturation and color temperature:

```yaml
devices:
    '0x12345678':
        friendly_name: my_light
        homeassistant:
            light:
                supported_color_modes: ['hs', 'color_temp']
```

### Exposing switch as a light

If your device is currently discovered as a switch and you want to discover it as a light, the following config in the Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml` can be used:

```yaml
devices:
    '0x12345678':
        friendly_name: my_switch
        homeassistant:
            switch:
                type: light
                object_id: light
            light:
                name: null
                value_template: null
                state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state }}'
            # OR if your devices has multiple endpoints (e.g. left/right)
            switch_left:
                type: light
                object_id: light_left
            light_left:
                name: my_switch_left
                value_template: null
                state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state_left }}'
            switch_right:
                type: light
                object_id: light_right
            light_right:
                name: my_switch_right
                value_template: null
                state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state_right }}'
```

### Changing device properties

As an advanced example to show changing any MQTT property can be overridden, the following configuration changes the `suggested_area` property of the `device`. The example shows that you can just copy the given MQTT discovery hierarchy underneath the `homeassistant` property (given that `suggested_area` is underneath the `device` property). Please note, that other `device` properties are possibly set by Zigbee2MQTT (e.g. `manufacturer`).

This example changes the [light's device's `suggested area` discovery property](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/#device) to "Living Room":

```yaml
devices:
    '0x12345678':
        friendly_name: my_light
        homeassistant:
            device:
                suggested_area: 'Living Room'
```

## Using a custom name for the device and entities

In order to get a more readable name for the device and entities in Home Assistant, a specific name for Home Assistant can be set in the device configuration. If set, this name will be used instead of `friendly_name`.

```yaml
devices:
    '0x12345678':
        friendly_name: living_room/temperature_sensor
        homeassistant:
            name: Living Room Temperature Sensor
```

## Controlling Zigbee2MQTT via Home Assistant

The following Home Assistant configuration allows you to control Zigbee2MQTT from Home Assistant.

You can add it to the appropriate section of your `configuration.yaml`, or you can add it as a [Home Assistant Package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) by adding the following to `zigbee2mqtt.yaml` in your packages folder.

```yaml
