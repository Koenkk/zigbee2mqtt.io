# MQTT Topics and Messages

This page describes which MQTT topics are used by Zigbee2MQTT. Note that the base topic (by default `zigbee2mqtt`) is configurable in the [Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml`](../../guide/configuration/). In Zigbee2MQTT 1.17.0 a new API was introduced, the documentation of the legacy api can be found [here](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt.io/blob/ead922ee141546ccce079430a7acce67c982c99b/docs/information/mqtt_topics_and_messages.md).

## zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME

The `FRIENDLY_NAME` is the IEEE-address or, if defined, the `friendly_name` of a device or group.

::: tip
You can use the `/` separator in `friendly_name` to structure devices and groups.
For example, using a `friendly_name` like `kitchen/floor_light` would result in a corresponding MQTT structure with `kitchen` as folder containing `floor_light` in MQTT Explorer.
:::

Published messages are **always** in a JSON format. Each device produces a different JSON message. To see what your device publishes check the "Exposes" section on the device page which can be accessed via ["Supported devices"](../../supported-devices/). Some examples:

**Xiaomi MiJia temperature & humidity sensor (WSDCGQ01LM)**

```json
{
    "temperature": 27.34,
    "humidity": 44.72
}
```

**Xiaomi MiJia wireless switch (WXKG01LM)**

```json
{
    "action": "single"
}
```

**Xiaomi MiJia human body movement sensor (RTCGQ01LM)**

```json
{
    "occupancy": true
}
```

**IKEA TRADFRI LED bulb E27 980 lumen, dimmable, white spectrum, opal white (LED1545G12)**

```json
{
    "state": "ON",
    "brightness": 215,
    "color_temp": 325
}
```

## zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/availability

If ["Device-Availability"](../configuration/device-availability.md) is configured the online/offline status will be published when it changes.

## zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set

Publishing messages to this topic allows you to control your Zigbee devices or groups via MQTT. Only accepts JSON messages. An example to control a Philips Hue Go (7146060PH). How to control a specific device can be found in the _Exposes_ section on the device page which can be accessed via ["Supported devices"](../../supported-devices/).

```js
{
  "state": "ON", // Or "OFF", "TOGGLE"
  "brightness": 255, // Value between 0 and 255
  "color": {"x": 0.123, "y": 0.123} // Color in XY
}
```

If FRIENDLY_NAME refers to a group, it will set the state for all devices in that group.

### Without JSON

In case you don't want to use JSON, publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set/state` with payload `ON` is the same as publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set` payload `{"state": "ON"}`.

### Publishing messages

Publishing messages depends on the MQTT client you use. For example to publish a message using the command line with mosquitto you can use the command

```bash
 mosquitto_pub -t 'zigbee2mqtt/0x0fffffffffffffff/set' -m '{ "state": "ON" }'
```

#### Directly reading/writing ZCL attributes

For development/debug purposes it's possible to directly send read/write attribute requests to a device through this endpoint.
Clusters and attributes can be referred to either by name or ID.
For all available names within Zigbee2MQTT please refer to [cluster.ts](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/blob/master/src/zspec/zcl/definition/cluster.ts).

##### Read requests:

```js
{
  "read": {
    "cluster": genBasic, // Either name (if defined in standard) or ID of cluster can be used
    "attributes": [1]    // Either name (if defined in standard) or ID of attribute can be used
  }
}
```

##### Write requests:

Writing one or multiple attributes can be done in multiple ways:

```js
{
  "write": {
    "cluster": "genBasic" // Either the name or ID can be used.
    "payload" {
      // If the attribute ID is one of the predefined types you can directly write using key:value
      "manufacturerName": "Best Manufacturer"
      // If the attribute ID is not a predefined one (out of the ZCL specifications)
      // it still can be written with the following syntax.
      "0": // ID
      {
          "value": "Best Manufacturer",
          "type": 66 // type enum as defined in ZCL specifications. Can be found using a `read` command or from specifications.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get

This is the counterpart of the `set` command. It allows you to read a value from a device. To read e.g. the state of a device send the payload `{"state": ""}`. What you can `/get` is specified on the device page under the _Exposes_ section.

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/info

Contains information of the bridge.
Whenever one of the attributes in the payload changes, this is republished.
Example payload:

```json
{
    "version":"1.13.0-dev",
    "commit":"772f6c0",
    "coordinator":{
        "ieee_address": "0x12345678",
        "type":"zStack30x",
        "meta":{"revision":20190425, "transportrev":2, "product":2, "majorrel":2, "minorrel":7, "maintrel":2}
    },

    "zigbee_herdsman":{"version":"0.20.0"},
    "network":{"channel":15,"pan_id":5674,"extended_pan_id":[0,11,22]},
    "log_level":"debug",
    "permit_join":true,
    "permit_join_end": 1733666394, // Epoch time when permit join will end, `undefined` if permit join is disabled.
    "config": {...}, // Will contain the complete Zigbee2MQTT config expect the network_key
    "config_schema": {...}, // Will contain the JSON schema of the config
    "restart_required": false // Indicates whether Zigbee2MQTT needs to be restarted to apply options set through zigbee2mqtt/request/bridge/options
}
```

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state

Contains the state of the bridge, this message is published as retained. Payloads are:

- `{"state":"online"}`: published when the bridge is running (on startup)
- `{"state":"offline"}`: published right before the bridge stops

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/logging

All Zigbee2MQTT logging, except the `debug` level, is published to this topic in the form of `{"level": LEVEL, "message": MESSAGE, "namespace": NAMESPACE}`, example: `{"level": "info", "message": "Zigbee: allowing new devices to join.", "namespace": "z2m"}`.

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/devices

Contains the devices connected to the bridge, this message is published as retained.
Whenever a devices joins or leaves this is republished.
In case `supported` is `false`, `definition` will be `null`.
Example payload:

]
```

### Exposes/options

A device definition will always have an `exposes` and `options` property which are a lists containing expose objects. The expose format is documented in [Exposes](./exposes.md).

- `exposes` This contains all the device capabilities (e.g. switch, light, occupancy)
- `options` Contains all the device options (e.g. `temperature_precision`) which can be set through `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/options`

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/definitions

Contains the zigbee clusters definitions of the devices, this message is published as retained and is structured with 2 parts:

- `clusters`: contains the official cluster definition from the `zigbee-herdsman` package, organized by cluster name
- `custom_clusters`: contains the custom cluster definitions from the `zigbee-herdsman-converts` package, of devices currently used

Example payload:

```json
{
  "clusters": {
    "genBasic": {ID: 0, ...},
    "genPowerCfg" : {ID: 1, ...},
  },
  "custom_clusters": {
    "0x12345678": {
       "myManuspecificCluster": {"ID": 0xFC01, ...},
    }
  }
}
```

The message is updated at startup and when a device is joining/leaving/reconfiguring.

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/groups

Contains the groups, this message is published as retained.
Whenever a group is added/removed or when devices are added/removed from a group this is republished.
Example payload:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "friendly_name": "my_group",
        "scenes": [{"id": 1, "name": "Scene 1"}],
        "members": [
            {
                "ieee_address": "0x90fd9ffffe6494fc",
                "endpoint": 1
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event

Events will be published to this topic. Possible types are `device_joined`, `device_interview`, `device_leave`, `device_announce`. Example payloads:

- `{"type":"device_joined","data":{"friendly_name":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc"}}`
- `{"type":"device_announce","data":{"friendly_name":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc"}}`
- `{"type":"device_interview","data":{"friendly_name":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","status":"started","ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc"}}`
- `{"type":"device_interview","data":{"friendly_name":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","status":"successful","ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","supported":true,"definition":{"model":"LED1624G9","vendor":"IKEA","description":"TRADFRI LED bulb E14/E26/E27 600 lumen, dimmable, color, opal white"}}}`
- `{"type":"device_interview","data":{"friendly_name":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","status":"failed","ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc"}}`
- `{"type":"device_leave","data":{"ieee_address":"0x90fd9ffffe6494fc","friendly_name":"my_bulb"}}`

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/extensions

See [External extensions](../../advanced/more/external_extensions.md).

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/converters

See [External converters](../../advanced/more/external_converters.md).

## zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/+

This can be used to e.g. configure certain settings like allowing new devices to join. Zigbee2MQTT will always respond with the same topic on `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/response/+`. The response payload will at least contain a `status` and `data` property, `status` is either `ok` or `error`. If `status` is `error` it will also contain an `error` property containing a description of the error.

Example: when publishing `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/permit_join` with payload `{"value": true}` Zigbee2MQTT will respond to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/response/permit_join` with payload `{"data":{"value":true},"status":"ok"}`. In case this request failed the response will be `{"data":{}, "error": "Failed to connect to adapter","status":"error"}`.

Optionally, a `transaction` property can be included in the request. This allows to easily match requests with responses. When a `transaction` property is included Zigbee2MQTT will include it in the response. Example: `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/permit_join` with payload `{"value": true, "transaction":23}` will be responded to on `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/response/permit_join` with payload `{"data":{"value":true},"status":"ok","transaction":23}`.

For requests where a device is involved you can select a specific endpoint by adding `/ENDPOINT_ID` where `ENDPOINT_ID` is the endpoint number (e.g `1`, `2`) or the endpoint name (e.g. `left`, `l1`). By default the first endpoint is taken. Example of a `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind` payload: `{"from": "my_remote/left", "to": "my_bulb"}`.

### Possible requests

### General

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/permit_join

Allows or disallows joining of new devices for the specified duration (in seconds).

Allowed payloads:

> Enable for maximum duration:
>
> ```json
> {"time": 254}
> ```
>
> Disable:
>
> ```json
> {"time": 0}
> ```
>
> Enable only for device with given `friendly_name`:
>
> ```json
> {"time": 60, "device": "bulb"}
> ```
>
> Enable only for coordinator:
>
> ```json
> {"time": 60, "device": "coordinator"}
> ```

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/health_check

Allows to check whether Zigbee2MQTT is healthy. Payload has to be empty, example response: `{"data":{"healthy":true},"status":"ok"}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/coordinator_check

Allows to check to execute a coordinator check. Payload has to be empty, example response: `{"data":{"missing_routers":[{"friendly_name":"bulb","ieee_address":"0x000b57fffec6a5b2"}]},"status":"ok"}`.

This check is only supported for Texas Instruments based adapters (e.g. CC2652/CC1352). It checks whether any routers are missing from the coordinator memory. In case routers are missing, you may experience one of the following problems:

- Unable to pair devices to your network, pairing might fail for any device that tries to joins the network via this missing router.
- Devices falling of the network. Sometimes devices that are in the network re-join it, if they try to re-join via this missing router, re-joining will fail.

The solution is to re-pair the missing routers. There are 2 known reasons for routers to go missing:

- Migration from a Zigbee 1.2 coordinator to 3.0 (e.g. CC2530/CC2531 -> CC2652/CC1352) without re-pairing any devices. This is because Zigbee 1.2 has less strict security requirements.
- Upgrading of the firmware, this seems to occur because of a bug in the Texas Instruments SDK.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/restart

Restarts Zigbee2MQTT. Payload has to be empty, example response: `{"data":{},"status":"ok"}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/networkmap

**WARNING: During the networkmap scan your network will be not/less responsive. Depending on the size of your network this can take somewhere between 10 seconds and 2 minutes. Therefore it is recommended to only trigger these scans manually!**

Allows you to retrieve a map of your Zigbee network. Payload format is `{"type": TYPE, "routes": BOOL}` or `TYPE`, example: `graphviz`, response `{"data":{"value": "NETWORKMAP","type":"graphviz","routes":false},"status":"ok"}`. Possible types are `raw`, `graphviz` and `plantuml`. In case you want to include routes set `routes` to `true`, `routes` is optional and is `false` by default.

Use [webgraphviz.com](http://www.webgraphviz.com/) (for `graphviz`), [planttext.com](https://www.planttext.com/) (for `plantuml`), or other tools to generate the network graph.

The graphviz map shows the devices as follows:

- **Coordinator:** rectangle with bold outline
- **Router:** rectangle with rounded corners
- **End device:** rectangle with rounded corners and dashed outline

Links are labelled with link quality (0..255) and active routes (listed by short 16 bit destination address). Arrow indicates direction of messaging. Coordinator and routers will typically have two lines for each connection showing bi-directional message path. Line style is:

- To **end devices**: normal line
- To and between **coordinator** and **routers**: heavy line for active routes or thin line for no active routes

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/extension/save

See [External extensions](../../advanced/more/external_extensions.md).

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/extension/remove

See [External extensions](../../advanced/more/external_extensions.md).

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/converter/save

See [External converters](../../advanced/more/external_converters.md).

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/converter/remove

See [External converters](../../advanced/more/external_converters.md).

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/backup

Creates a backup of the `data` folder (without the `data/log` directory). Payload has to be empty, example response: `{"data":{"zip":"WklHQkVFMk1RVFQuUk9DS1M="},"status":"ok"}`. The `zip` property represents a zip file encoded via Base64. Note that not all adapters support backup (`coordinator_backup.json`), see [adapters](../adapters/README.md) for more details.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/install_code/add

Allows to add an install code to the coordinator. Use this when you want to pair a Zigbee 3.0 devices which can only be paired with an install code. These devices typically have a QR code on it. When scanning this QR code you will get a code, e.g. `ZB10SG0D831018234800400000000000000000009035EAFFFE424793DLKAE3B287281CF11F550733A0CFC38AA31E802`. Publish this code to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/install_code/add` with payload `{"value":"THE_CODE"}`. Example response: `{"data":{"value":"THE_CODE"},"status":"ok"}`.

### Device

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/remove

Removes a device from the network. Allowed payloads are `{"id": "deviceID"}` or `deviceID` where deviceID can be the `ieee_address` or `friendly_name` of the device. Example; request: `{"id": "my_bulb"}` or `my_bulb`, response: `{"data":{"id": "my_bulb","block":false,"force":false},"status":"ok"}`.

Note that in Zigbee the coordinator can only **request** a device to remove itself from the network.
Which means that in case a device refuses to respond to this request it is not removed from the network.
This can happen for e.g. battery powered devices which are sleeping and thus not receiving this request.
In case removal fails the response will be e.g. `{"data":{"id": "my_bulb","block":false,"force":false},"status":"error","error":"Failed to remove dimmer (Error: AREQ - ZDO - mgmtLeaveRsp after 10000ms)"}`.

An alternative way to remove the device is by factory resetting it, this probably won't work for all devices as it depends on the device itself.
In case the device did remove itself from the network, you will get a `device_leave` event on `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event`.

In case all of the above fails, you can force remove a device. Note that a force remove will **only** remove the device from the database. Until this device is factory reset, it will still hold the network encryption key and thus is still able to communicate over the network!
To force remove a device add the optional `force` property (default `false`) to the payload, example: `{"id":"my_bulb","force":true}`.

In case you also want to block the device the optional `block` property (default `false`) can be added, example: `{"id":"my_bulb","block":true}`. Note that Zigbee doesn't have a block functionality, therefore when a device is blocked, Zigbee2MQTT will immediately request the device to remove itself from the network when it joins.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/ota_update/unschedule

See [OTA updates](./ota_updates.md).

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/configure

Allows to manually trigger a re-configure of the device. Should only be used when the device is not working as expected (e.g. not reporting certain values), not all devices can be configured (only when the definition has a `configure` in its [definition](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters/blob/master/devices)). Allowed payloads are `{"id": "deviceID"}` or `deviceID` where deviceID can be the `ieee_address` or `friendly_name` of the device. Example; request: `{"id": "my_remote"}` or `my_remote`, response: `{"data":{"id": "my_remote"},"status":"ok"}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/interview

Allows you to manually trigger an interview for a specified device, causing zigbee2mqtt to reads its endpoints, clusters, and basic attributes. A device interview usually only occurs after the initial pairing, but it is sometimes useful to perform an interview after a firmware upgrade adds new functionality. Payload format is `{"id": "deviceID"}` where deviceID can be the `ieee_address` or `friendly_name` of the device, example: `{"id": "my_bulb"}`, response: `{"data":{"id": "my_bulb"},"status":"ok"}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/options

Allows you to change device options on the fly. Existing options can be changed or new ones can be added. Payload format is `{"id": deviceID,"options": OPTIONS}` where deviceID can be the `ieee_address` or `friendly_name` of the device, example: `{"id": "my_bulb", "options":{"transition":1}}`. Response will be `{"data":{"from":{"retain":false},"to":{"retain":false,"transition":1},"id":"my_bulb","restart_required":false},"status":"ok"}`. Some options may require restarting Zigbee2MQTT, in this case `restart_required` is set to `true`. Note that `restart_required` is also published to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/info`. Use `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/restart` to restart Zigbee2MQTT.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/rename

Allows you to change the `friendly_name` of a device on the fly. Payload format is `{"from": deviceID, "to": deviceID}` where deviceID can be the `ieee_address` or `friendly_name` of the device, example: `{"from": "my_bulb", "to": "my_bulb_new_name"}`. Response will be `{"data":{"from":"my_bulb","to":"my_bulb_new_name","homeassistant_rename":false},"status":"ok"}`.

In case you are using Home Assistant discovery and also want to update the entity ID according to this new name, send e.g. `{"from": "my_bulb", "to": "my_bulb_new_name","homeassistant_rename":true}`

In case you want to rename the last joined device, omit the `from` property and set `last` to `true`. Example: `{"last": true, "to": "my_bulb_new_name"}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/configure_reporting

Allows to send a Zigbee configure reporting command to a device. Zigbee devices often have attributes that can report changes in their state, such as temperature, humidity, battery level, etc. Attribute reporting allows these devices to automatically send updates when there is a change in the values of these attributes.
One example is when you change brightness of a bulb with its remote instead of Zigbee2MQTT, the state becomes out of sync.
By setting up reporting for the bulb it will send notifications to Zigbee2MQTT about the brightness change and can update state in Zigbee2MQTT.

It is a good practice to keep a balance between staying updated with relevant information and conserving energy, especially in the case of battery-powered devices.

Refer to the Configure Reporting Command in the [ZigBee Cluster Library](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/wiki/References#csa-zigbee-alliance-spec) for more information. Example payload is `{"id":"my_bulb","endpoint":1,"cluster":"genLevelCtrl","attribute":"currentLevel","minimum_report_interval":5,"maximum_report_interval":10,"reportable_change":10}`. In this case the response would be `{"data":{"id":"my_bulb","endpoint":1,"cluster":"genLevelCtrl","attribute":"currentLevel","minimum_report_interval":5,"maximum_report_interval":"10","reportable_change":10},"status":"ok"}`.

Parameters

**Minimum reporting interval** (minimum_report_interval)
In other words: how long after the attribute changes on the device should it send an update.
A value of 0 means: send an update as soon as the attribute (e.g.: temperature) changes.

**Maximum reporting interval** (maximum_report_interval)
In other words: how frequently shall the device send a report if there is no change in the attribute constantly.
A value of 60 means: if the bulb is off for 30 minutes, it still sends 30 updates (every 60 seconds) even if there was no any attribute changes(e.g.: it was not turned on or off).

**Minimum reporting change** (reportable_change)
The Minimum Reporting Change is like telling your device to speak up only when something significant happens.
If you set a minimum reporting change of 1 degree for a temperature sensor, it means the sensor won't bother you with updates unless the temperature changes by at least 1 degree.
It's a way to filter out minor fluctuations and focus on important changes in the environment.

To disable reporting set the `maximum_report_interval` to `65535`.

Notes:

- Not all devices support the Zigbee configure reporting command (e.g. Xiaomi WSDCGQ11LM temperature/humidity sensors don't support it)
- If configure reporting fails for a battery powered device make sure to wake it up right before sending the command.
- The `reportable_change` value depends on the unit of the attribute, e.g. for temperature 100 means in general 1°C of change.
- To specify options, e.g. the manufacturerCode use e.g. `{"id":"my_bulb","cluster":"genLevelCtrl","attribute":"currentLevel","minimum_report_interval":5,"maximum_report_interval":10,"reportable_change":10,"options":{"manufacturerCode":1234}}`

### Group

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/group/remove

Removes a group. Allowed payloads are `{"id": "groupID"}` or `groupID` where groupID can be the `groupID` or `friendly_name` of the group. Example; request: `{"id": "my_group"}` or `my_group`, response: `{"data":{"id": "my_group", "force": false},"status":"ok"}`.

Group removal can fail if one of the devices fails to remove itself from the group (e.g. due to being offline). In this case you can force a group removal by setting the optional `force` property to `true`, example payload `{"id": "my_group", "force": true}`. Note that in this case the device will still be in the group, in case the groupID is later reused, the device will be part of that group.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/group/add

Adds a group. Allowed payloads are `{"friendly_name": NAME, "id": NUMBER}` or `NAME`. Example; request: `{"id": 9, "friendly_name": "new_group"}` or `new_group`, response: `{"data":{"id": 9,"friendly_name":"new_group"},"status":"ok"}`. The `id` property is optional.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/group/rename

Allows you to change the `friendly_name` of a group on the fly. Payload format is `{"from": groupID, "to": groupID}` where groupID can be the `groupID` or `friendly_name` of the group, example: `{"from": "my_group", "to": "my_group_new_name"}`. Response will be `{"data":{"from":"my_group","to":"my_group_new_name"},"status":"ok"}`.

In case you are using Home Assistant discovery and also want to update the entity ID according to this new name, send e.g. `{"from": "my_group", "to": "my_group_new_name","homeassistant_rename":true}`.

#### zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/group/options

Allows you to change group options on the fly. Existing options can be changed or new ones can be added. Payload format is `{"id": groupID,"options": OPTIONS}` where groupID can be the `group_ID` or `friendly_name` of the group, example: `{"id": "my_group", "options":{"transition":1}}`. Response will be `{"data":{"from":{"retain":false},"to":{"retain":false,"transition":1},"id":"my_group","restart_required":false},"status":"ok"}`. Some options may require restarting Zigbee2MQTT, in this case `restart_required` is set to `true`. Note that `restart_required` is also published to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/info`. Use `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/restart` to restart Zigbee2MQTT.
