This list gives only a narrow overview. To use Zigbee2MQTT with other systems it's not
mandatory to have a _native_ integration but support for MQTT. A native integration just makes things more easy and "clickable".
You could implement custom logic - like switch Light-X ON after sunrise when motion detector triggers - by
subscribing and publishing to the relevant MQTT-Topics.

There are many tools to implement logic based on MQTT like NodeRED (flow based) or
[MQTT-Scripts](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/mqtt-scripts) (javascript). Almost every programming-language
has some libs to communicate with MQTT, so you can write your own logic with your preferred language or tool.

A low-level MQTT client like [MQTT-Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) can help to understand the topic structure
and publish values to test the behaviour.
