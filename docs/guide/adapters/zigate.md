# ZiGate coordinators

::: warning ATTENTION

Support for this coordinator is **experimental**, not recommended yet for production setups

:::

Initial development started on experimental (alpha stage) support for various ZigGate coordinators. This includes all ZiGate compatible hardware coordinators which are currently based on NXP Zigbee MCU chips like JN5168 and JN5169 with ZigGate 3.1d firmware or later.

::: warning ATTENTION
Various features are not supported by this coordinator, in case you depend on these features, consider a different coordinator.

- [Changing the channel](../configuration/zigbee-network.md#changing-the-zigbee-channel), changing requires re-pairing all devices.
- Adding [install codes](../../guide/usage/mqtt_topics_and_messages.md#zigbee2mqttbridgerequestinstall_codeadd), which is required to pair some devices.
- [Backups](../../guide/usage/mqtt_topics_and_messages.md#zigbee2mqttbridgerequestbackup)
- Inter-PAN, which is required for [touchlink](../../guide/usage/touchlink.md)
