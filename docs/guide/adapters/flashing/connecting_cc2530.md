# Connecting the CC2530

## Pin layouts

The pin layout is different between each CC2530 module

| Name                  | Pin layout                                                                             | Picture                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

## Using a USB to serial adapter

### Confirmed working

This how-to has been confirmed working with the following CC2530 based devices:

| Device     | Image                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CC2530** | ![CC2530](../../../images/cc2530.jpg) |

and the following USB to serial adapters:

| Device     | Image                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **CP2102** | ![CP2102](../../../images/CP2102.png) |

##### Flashing the firmware

The required coordinator firmware can be found here: [Zigbee 1.2](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin) and [Zigbee 3.0](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.0.x/bin).

### Connecting

Connect to CC2530 to the USB to serial adapter using the following mapping:

| USB-Serial Adapter | CC2530 |
| :----------------: | :----: |
|        3V3         |  VCC   |
|        GND         |  GND   |
|        TXD         |  P02   |
|        RXD         |  P03   |

Now plug in the USB-to-serial adapter in your USB port and start Zigbee2MQTT, enjoy!

## To a Raspberry Pi (Zero)

CC2530 can be connected to a Raspberry PI (Zero) via GPIO Pins - no USB2FTDI is needed.

The use of UART by the installed Linux has to be disabled: [Detailed explanation here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md)

Enable UART in the Kernel and disable UART use for BlueTooth.

In `/boot/config.txt` add following lines:

```
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
```

Disable the modem system service (on the command line):

```
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
```

Remove the console entry by removing any of those entries from `/boot/cmdline.txt` if present:

```
console=serial0,115200 console=ttyAMA0,115200

```

Reboot your Raspberry.

### Wiring CC2530 to the Raspberry

```
CC C2530 -> Raspberry
VCC -> 3,3V (Pin1)
GND -> GND (Pin6)
P02 -> TXD (Pin8 / BCM 14)
P03 -> RXD (Pin10 / BCM 15)
```

### Configuring Zigbee2MQTT

Change the Serial Port in your `data/configuration.yaml` file:

```
serial:
  port: /dev/ttyAMA0
```

Have fun.

## Via an ESP8266 as a serial to WiFi bridge

This setup allows you to connect a CC2530 to an ESP8266 which can be put everywhere in your house. Via a serial socket, Zigbee2MQTT will connect to your CC2530.

### Wiring

Wire the CC2530 to the ESP8266 using the following scheme:

| ESP8266 | CC2530 |
| :-----: | :----: |
|   3v3   |  VCC   |
|   GND   |  GND   |
|   TX    |  P02   |
|   RX    |  P03   |
|   GND   |  P20   |
|   GND   |  P04   |
|   GND   |  P05   |

### Option 1 - Flashing the ESP8266 with ESPEasy

The ESP8266 needs to be flashed with ESPEasy. ESPEasy has sufficient documentation on how to get you up and running:

- [How to flash the ESP8266 with ESPEasy](https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorial_ESPEasy_Firmware_Upload)
- ESP8266 firmware: [ESP_Easy_mega-XXXXXXXX_normal_ESP8266_4096.bin](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/releases)
- [More information about ESPEasy](https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/ESPEasy#Introduction)

### Setting up ESPEasy

Open the ESPEasy web interface and complete the setup. Afterwards open the web interface again.

Click on _Devices_ Edit of the first task and select _Communication - Serial Server_ from the dropdown list.

Fill in the form as following:

```
a.    Name: ZIGBEE2MQTT
b.    Enabled: checked
c.    TCP Port: a number between 1000 and 9999 "1775"
d.    Baud Rate: 115200
e.    Data bits: 8
f.    Parity: No Parity
g.    Stop bits: 1
h.    Reset target after boot: - none â€“
i.    RX receive timeout: 0
j.    Event processing: Generic
```

Press Submit, the setup is now completed.

### Option 2 - Flashing the ESP8266 with Tasmota

The ESP8266 needs to be flashed with Tasmota firmware, **"zbbridge" build**. Please find flashing instructions in the following guides:

- [Tasmota github](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)
- [Getting started](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/)
- [Serial to TCP Bridge docs](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Serial-to-TCP-Bridge/)

You don't need MQTT for the serial to network functionality but it is a nice option to monitor your bridge.

### Setting up Tasmota

Open the Tasmota web interface and complete the basic network setup. Next in "Configuration", "Configure Module" define your RX and TX pins. The Rx/Tx are relative to the ESP device. For example with ESP8266/ESP01's hardware serial, set GPIO1 as `TCP Tx` and GPIO3 as `TCP Rx`.

Next, in Tasmota's main screen, open "Console". Enter `TCPBaudRate 115200`. Decide on the port number to use and set it. For example for port = 8888 run:

```
Rule1 ON System#Boot do TCPStart 8888 endon
Rule1 1
```

### Zigbee2MQTT configuration

Now add the following to the Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
serial:
    port: 'tcp://192.168.2.13:20108'
    adapter: zstack
```

Note to change the IP address and port.
You can now start Zigbee2qmtt.
