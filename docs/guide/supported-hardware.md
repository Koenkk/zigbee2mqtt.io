# Supported Hardware

## Zigbee Adapters

Zigbee2MQTT supports a range of Adapters which enable communication with the Zigbee radio network.
Most adapters are connected on a USB port but there are options to use GPIO-Pins or [connect it remotely](../advanced/remote-adapter/connect_to_a_remote_adapter.md)
over TCP using a WIFI or Ethernet network. See the [list of supported Zigbee Adapters](./adapters/)

## Zigbee Devices

Currently there are plenty of [supported Zigbee Devices](../supported-devices/) with a rising trend.
If your device is not supported yet check out [how to support new devices](../advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.md) and contribute to Zigbee2MQTT.
