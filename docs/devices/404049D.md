### Pairing
Remove the battery cover and use the cover to press the button above the batteries.
Press and hold this button for 10-20 seconds and release the button.
After that the remote should show up as a paired device.

### Groups binding

This remote is able to deal with 4 ZigBee groups:

* group0 = All three leds lit
* group1 = first led lit
* group2 = second led lit
* group3 = third let lit

The device is bound to the default tint action groups (group0-3) with ids 16387/16388/16389/16390. This cannot be changed.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
