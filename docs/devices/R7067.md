## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `local_temperature`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `system_mode`, `preset`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `0` and `30`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: auto - Automatic mode. heat - Manual mode.. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `auto`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `Comfort`, `Eco`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.

### Away mode (switch)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `away_mode` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"away_mode": "ON"}`, `{"away_mode": "OFF"}` or `{"away_mode": "undefined"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Comfort temperature (numeric)
Comfort temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `comfort_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"comfort_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `30`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Eco temperature (numeric)
Eco temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `eco_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"eco_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Local temperature calibration (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `local_temperature_calibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-5.5` and the maximum value is `5.5`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Window detection (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_detection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `ON` window detection is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Window detection temperature (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_detection_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"window_detection_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `30`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Window detection time (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_detection_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"window_detection_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `60`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Boost heating (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `boost_heating` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"boost_heating": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` boost heating is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Boost time (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `boost_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
