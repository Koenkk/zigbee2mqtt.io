### About the 4th bottom switch
This button acts as a master switch -- toggles the full on and off of the other three switches
This button exposes NO endpoint
Long-press this button 2s --> pair mode (all light(s) blink 2 times), if the light(s) stay on, it means the pairing is successful
Long-press this button 10s --> unpair mode, all light(s) will blink 4 times
