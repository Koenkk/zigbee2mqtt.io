* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance_lux value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Illuminance (lux) (numeric)
Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Sensitivity (enum)
PIR sensor sensitivity (refresh and update only while active).
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Keep time (enum)
PIR keep time in seconds (refresh and update only while active).
Value can be found in the published state on the `keep_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keep_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `30`, `60`, `120`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
