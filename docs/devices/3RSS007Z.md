# Third Reality 3RSS007Z

| Model | 3RSS007Z  |
| Vendor  | Third Reality  |
| Description | Smart light switch |
| Supports | on/off |
| Picture | ![Third Reality 3RSS007Z](../images/devices/3RSS007Z.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing mode
To put the device in pairing mode, hold the switch's button for 30 seconds until LED starts blinking fast (2 blinks per second)

### Swap ON/OFF
If the switch is showing off when it is actually on, hold the button till the LED comes on then release, it will change the switch position while keeping the current state.



## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
