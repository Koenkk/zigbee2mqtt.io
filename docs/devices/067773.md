## Notes


### Legacy integration
By default (for backwards compatibility purposes) the legacy integration is enabled.
For new users it is recommended to **disable** this as it has several fundamental problems.
To disable the legacy integration add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    legacy: false
```


### Model numbers
Model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices.
French models are branded as Céliane with Netatmo, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "0 677 23", "0 677 73", and "0 648 93".
Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "7 418 13", "7 418 43" and "7 418 73".
American models are branded as radiant with Netatmo, model numbers are the same as the French ones, but sized for American boxes and plates.

### Binding
The remote supports [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md).

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `legacy`: Set to false to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended), will change structure of the published payload (default true). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval.  Note: will only work when legacy: false is set. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
