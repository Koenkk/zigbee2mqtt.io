## Notes


### Warning usage
Warning only support a single mode, `burglar`

Duration of using `warning` can be shorter than `max_duration` but not longer. If `max_duration` are set to 60 seconds, and you try to set `warning` with `duration` of 90 seconds, the warning will only apply for 60 seconds. Default value of `max_duration` are 300 seconds

This device do not support the `strobe_duty_cycle` functionality


### Triggering alarm, Advanced
This siren can be triggered manually by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with the payloads:

To start :
* `{"warning":{"duration":60,"level":"low","mode":"burglar","strobe":false,"strobe_duty_cycle":0}}`
Where:
- `duration`: the number of seconds the alarm will be on
- `level`: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `mode`: `stop`, `burglar`
- `strobe`: `true`, `false`
- `strobe_duty_cycle`: not supported

To stop:
* `{"warning":{"duration":60,"level":"low","mode":"stop","strobe":false,"strobe_duty_cycle":0}}`

### Triggering alarm, Simple
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alarm": "START"}` and `{"alarm": "OFF"}`
Set `max_duration` from the Zigbee2MQTT UI or by publishing `{"max_duration": NEW_VALUE}`
This alarm are preset to highest volume
