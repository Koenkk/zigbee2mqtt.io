<!-- Notes BEGIN: You can edit here. Add "## Notes" headline if not already present. -->
## Notes
The output is only driven once the input signal is released, hence making this device difficult to work with non-momentary switches.

### Pairing
Press on pair button for 10 seconds to enter pairing mode

### Calibration

* Press the open button on the switch, wait until the curtains are completely open.
* Press the same button on the switch again to 'stop'.
* Put the device into calibration mode, see [below](#calibration-binary).
* Press the close button on the switch, wait until curtains are fully closed.
* Press the same button on the switch.
* Disable the calibration mode, see [below](#calibration-binary).

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `invert_cover`: Inverts the cover position, false: open=100,close=0, true: open=0,close=100 (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `cover_position_tilt_disable_report`: Do not publish set cover target position as a normal 'position' value (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Moving (enum, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `moving_left` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `UP`, `STOP`, `DOWN`.

### Moving (enum, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `moving_right` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `UP`, `STOP`, `DOWN`.

### Calibration time (numeric, left endpoint)
Calibration time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_time_left` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Calibration time (numeric, right endpoint)
Calibration time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_time_right` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Cover (left endpoint)
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state_left` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_left": "OPEN"}`, `{"state_left": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state_left": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position_left": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Calibration (binary, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_left` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration_left": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration_left": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` calibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Motor reversal (binary, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motor_reversal_left` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motor_reversal_left": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motor_reversal_left": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` motor reversal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Cover (right endpoint)
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state_right` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_right": "OPEN"}`, `{"state_right": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state_right": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position_right": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Calibration (binary, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_right` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration_right": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration_right": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` calibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Motor reversal (binary, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motor_reversal_right` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motor_reversal_right": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motor_reversal_right": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` motor reversal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.
