## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Power outage memory (enum)
Recover state after power outage.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_outage_memory` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_outage_memory": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_outage_memory": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `restore`.

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature calibration (numeric)
Temperature calibration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_calibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_calibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-10` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Humidity calibration (numeric)
Humidity calibration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity_calibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"humidity_calibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-10` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature sensitivity (numeric)
Temperature sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0.1` and the maximum value is `1`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Humidity sensitivity (numeric)
Humidity sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"humidity_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Manual mode (binary)
Manual mode or automatic.
Value can be found in the published state on the `manual_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"manual_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` manual mode is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Auto settings (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"auto_settings": {"enabled": VALUE, "temp_greater_then": VALUE, "temp_greater_value": VALUE, "temp_lower_then": VALUE, "temp_lower_value": VALUE}}`
- `enabled` (enum): Enable auto settings allowed values: `on`, `off`, `none`
- `temp_greater_then` (enum): Greater action allowed values: `on`, `off`, `none`
- `temp_greater_value` (numeric): Temperature greater than value min value is -20, max value is 80, unit is *C
- `temp_lower_then` (enum): Lower action allowed values: `on`, `off`, `none`
- `temp_lower_value` (numeric): Temperature lower than value min value is -20, max value is 80, unit is *C
