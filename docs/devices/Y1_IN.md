## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Keep sensitivity (numeric)
Keep sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `keep_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keep_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Trigger sensitivity (numeric)
Trigger sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `trigger_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

Value can be found in the published state on the `fading_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fading_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `60`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Target distance (numeric)
Distance to target.
Value can be found in the published state on the `target_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
