## Notes

You can get a detailed user manual on the [Ubisys](https://www.ubisys.de/en/support/manuals-catalogs/) website.

### Pairing
#### Initial pairing
1. make sure the H1 is mounted securely
2. enable joining in zigbee2mqtt
3. remove the plastic battery tab
4. wait, the TRV will first calibrate, after this is successful it will automatically try to join

If the display remains blank, try replacing the batteries. Mine shipped with empty batteries.

#### Pairing after the device has been calibrated
1. press the button to wake the display
2. press and hold the button for 10 seconds with the display wake
3. turn the dial until you see the 'factory reset' icon (gear with a arrow around it)
4. press the button once (icon should be flashing)
5. turn the dial until you see checkmark next to the icon
6. enable joining in zigbe2mqtt
7. press the button to confirm (the device will now reset, re-calibrate, and try to join)

### Turning off
You can turn off the H1 by setting the `system_mode` to `off` or by using the on device menu, the device will now be in frost protection mode and will not execute any schedules or try and heat to the setpoint.

You can turn on the device again by setting `system_mode` to `heat` or by turning the dial on the device.

### Vacation Mode
When in vacation mode (occupied heating) setpoint and schedule will be ignored. It will keep the room at 16ºC by default, however this can be changed by setting the unoccupied heating setpoint.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/<friendly_name>/set/unoccupied_heating_setpoint -m 14
```

### Scheduling
You can configure a schedule for the thermostat as wel, when the schedule ends the TRV will revert to the value configured in `occupied_heating_default_setpoint`.:w

### Remote Temperature
When running on a firmware version that is 1.5.0 or higher, you can now bind a sensor supporting `msTemperatureMeasurement` to the TRV.

```bash
# NOTE: if the msTemperatureMeasurement is not on endpoint 1, change the endpoint number on the sensor_friendly_name device.
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind -m '{"clusters":["msTemperatureMeasurement"],"from":"<sensor_friendly_name>/1","to":"<trv_friendly_name>/1"}'
```

You can configure how long the remote temperature remains valid by setting `remote_temperature_duration` which defaults to 1 hour. You can manually read the `remote_temperature` attribute to see what value the device is using.
It does not support reporting, when the value is not set or expire it will read as `-327.68`.
