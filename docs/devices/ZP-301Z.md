## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Human presence detected.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery value (numeric)
battery value in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Brightness value (numeric)
When the light brightness is activated after the lights are turned on.
Value can be found in the published state on the `brightness_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness_value": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Presence time (numeric)
How long to wait before turning on the lights after detecting a person and meeting the light conditions.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `60`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Presence delay (numeric)
How long after no one is detected will the lights turn off.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_delay": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `120`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Illuminance trigger (numeric)
Detection is only allowed when the illuminance is less than the current value..
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_trigger` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"illuminance_trigger": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10000`.

### Detection cycle (numeric)
How often is the battery level and illuminance detected.
Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_cycle` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"detection_cycle": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `10` and the maximum value is `1200`.
The unit of this value is `s`.
