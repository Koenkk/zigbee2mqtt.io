## Notes


### Pairing

Press the small reset button (at backside of the remote at the lower part of the battery lid) e.g. with a pin for about 4 seconds. The device will reset and try to join a network. The LED is switched on during the pairing process. If pairing fails it might work after repeating this procedure and lowering the distance to your Zigbee adapter.

Pairing directly to a nearby (distance ca. 5 cm) Müller Licht Tint bulb is possible by holding down the "power" and "dim down" buttons until the LED starts blinking.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_stop`, `recall_1`, `store_1`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
