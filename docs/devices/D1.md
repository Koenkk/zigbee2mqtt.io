## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device.
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load.

### Ballast Configuration
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set` the dimmer's ballast configuration attributes (`min_level` and `max_level`) can be set.
Example:
```json
{
    "ballast_config": {
        "min_level": 3
    }
}
```

By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get/ballast_config` the values of the ballast configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).
To account for errors due to missing optional attributes (since this is a general function), every cluster attribute will be queried separately and the complete process can therefore take a moment.


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    icon: "mdi:flash"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
