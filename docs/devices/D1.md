## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device.
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load.

### Ballast Configuration
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` the dimmer's ballast configuration attributes (`min_level` and `max_level`) can be set.
Example:
```json
{
    "ballast_config": {
        "min_level": 3
    }
}
```

By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/ballast_config` the values of the ballast configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).
To account for errors due to missing optional attributes (since this is a general function), every cluster attribute will be queried separately and the complete process can therefore take a moment.

### Dimmer strategy configuration
The dimmer phase control mode can be changed by publishing `{ "mode_phase_control": "MODE" }` to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` where `MODE` is one of the following values: `automatic` (default), `forward` or `reverse`.

A word of caution is in order: configuring the wrong dimmer phase control mode could destroy the device or the attached load!

More information can be found in the [ubisys D1 technical reference manual](https://www.smarthome-store.de/media/documents/ubisys-d1-technical-reference.pdf), chapter "7.2.8. Dimmer Setup Cluster (Server)".

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `measurement_poll_interval`: This device does not support reporting electric measurements so it is polled instead. The default poll interval is 60 seconds, set to -1 to disable. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `-1`

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness, color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.

#### Transition
For all of the above mentioned features it is possible to do a transition of the value over time. To do this add an additional property `transition` to the payload which is the transition time in seconds.
Examples: `{"brightness":156,"transition":3}`, `{"color_temp":241,"transition":1}`.

#### Moving/stepping
Instead of setting a value (e.g. brightness) directly it is also possible to:
- move: this will automatically move the value over time, to stop send value `stop` or `0`.
- step: this will increment/decrement the current value by the given one.

The direction of move and step can be either up or down, provide a negative value to move/step down, a positive value to move/step up.
To do this send a payload like below to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`

**NOTE**: brightness move/step will stop at the minimum brightness and won't turn on the light when it's off. In this case use `brightness_move_onoff`/`brightness_step_onoff`
````js
{
  "brightness_move": -40, // Starts moving brightness down at 40 units per second
  "brightness_move": 0, // Stop moving brightness
  "brightness_step": 40 // Increases brightness by 40
}
````

### Level config (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"level_config": {"on_off_transition_time": VALUE, "on_level": VALUE, "execute_if_off": VALUE, "current_level_startup": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"level_config": ""}`.
- `on_off_transition_time` (numeric): Specifies the amount of time, in units of 0.1 seconds, which will be used during a transition to either the on or off state, when an on/off/toggle command of the on/off cluster is used to turn the light on or off 
- `on_level` (numeric): Specifies the level that shall be applied, when an on/toggle command causes the light to turn on. min value is 1, max value is 254
- `execute_if_off` (binary): Defines if you can send a brightness change without to turn on the light allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `current_level_startup` (numeric): Specifies the initial level to be applied after the device is supplied with power min value is 1, max value is 254

Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

Value can be found in the published state on the `energy` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"energy": ""}`.

### Minimum on level (numeric)
Specifies the minimum level that shall be applied, when an on/toggle command causes the light to turn on. When this attribute is set to the invalid value (255) this feature is disabled and standard rules apply: The light will either return to the previously active level (before it was turned off) if the OnLevel attribute is set to the invalid value (255/previous); or to the specified value of the OnLevel attribute if this value is in the range 0…254. Otherwise, if the MinimumOnLevel is in the range 0…254, the light will be set to the the previously active level (before it was turned off), or the value specified here, whichever is the larger value. For example, if the previous level was 30 and the MinimumOnLevel was 40 then the light would turn on and move to level 40. Conversely, if the previous level was 50, and the MinimumOnLevel was 40, then the light would turn on and move to level 50..
