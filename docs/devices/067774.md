## Notes

### Model numbers
Model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices. For example:
- French models are branded as CÃ©liane with Netatmo, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "0 677 24", "0 677 74", and "0 677 94".
- Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "7 418 12", "7 418 42" and "7 418 72".

### Binding
The remote supports [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md) on each endpoint, so you can bind each button to a different device/group.
As part of its configuration, the remote expects to have a "group" binding configured for each of its button. Otherwise, it will consider itself not fully configured and send unnecessary commands on the zigbee network resulting in noticeable delay when controlling your device(s).
In a nutshell:
- When using devices bindings directly in Zigbee2MQTT, create groups with your target devices for each button and bind related groups accordingly.
- When using automations to control your devices (e.g. homeassistant), create a virtual group (empty) and bind it to the buttons. Beware that having both the coordinator and group bound to a remote's button will publish 2 MQTT messages

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
