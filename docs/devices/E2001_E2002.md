## Notes


### Pairing

Pair the switch to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button (found under the back cover next to the battery) 4 times in a row within 5 seconds. If this doesn't work, try pressing the pair button up to 10 times in very quick succession. The red light on the side should flash a few times and then turn off. After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off.

### Button -> `action` mapping

|Icon|Action|Exposed Action
|-----|-----|-----|
|Light large ( top )|push|on
|Light large ( top )|hold|brightness_move_up
|Light large ( top )|release|brightness_stop
|-----|-----|-----|
|Light small ( bottom )|push|off
|Light small ( bottom )|hold|brightness_move_down
|Light small ( bottom )|release|brightness_stop
|-----|-----|-----|
|Arrow left|push|arrow_left_click
|Arrow left|hold|arrow_left_hold
|Arrow left|release|arrow_left_release
|-----|-----|-----|
|Arrow right|push|arrow_right_click
|Arrow right|hold|arrow_right_hold
|Arrow right|release|arrow_right_release

For the arrow buttons it seems that the hold/move action takes a bit longer to be send.

### Latest firmware
IKEA has changed their firmware versioning after the original 1.0.0.24 leading to a notification "Firmware on ... is newer than latest firmware online", despite the online firmware being actually newer. Follow the instructions in [this issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/18515#issuecomment-1692857032) to force update the firmware. Note that the remote loses the capability to bind to a group in the latest firmware.

This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a with a maximum value of `30`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
