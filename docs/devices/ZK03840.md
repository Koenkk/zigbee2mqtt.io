# Viessmann ZK03840

| Model | ZK03840  |
| Vendor  | Viessmann  |
| Description | ViCare radiator thermostat valve |
| Supports | thermostat |
| Picture | ![Viessmann ZK03840](../images/devices/ZK03840.jpg) |

## Notes


### Installing the TRV
- install the correct adaptor on the valve
- open cover (push clip on bottom and push front side to slide open)
- insert batteries (`--` should be on the display)
- press the button on the top (`--` + `((•))` should be on the display)
- wait for the device to pair, it took about 2 minutes for me to get the success message in Zigbee2MQTT
- install the TRV on the adaptor (push hard until you feel a click, rotate the TRV until display faces up)
- press the button on the top for 3 seconds (motor will turn, `21°` + `((•))` should be on the display)
- close the cover


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    temperature_unit: "C"
    min_temp: "7"
    max_temp: "30"
    mode_state_topic: true
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json.system_mode }}"
    mode_command_topic: true
    current_temperature_topic: true
    current_temperature_template: "{{ value_json.local_temperature }}"
    temp_step: 1
    action_topic: true
    action_template: "{% set values = {'idle':'off','heat':'heating','cool':'cooling','fan only':'fan'} %}{{ values[value_json.running_state] }}"
    modes: 
      - "off"
      - "auto"
      - "heat"
    temperature_state_topic: true
    temperature_state_template: "{{ value_json.occupied_heating_setpoint }}"
    temperature_command_topic: "occupied_heating_setpoint"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
