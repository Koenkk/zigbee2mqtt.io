## Notes

### Installing the TRV
- install the correct adaptor on the valve
- open cover (push clip on bottom and push front side to slide open)
- insert batteries (`--` should be on the display)
- press the button on the top (`--` + `((•))` should be on the display)
- wait for the device to pair, it took about 2 minutes for me to get the success message in Zigbee2MQTT
- install the TRV on the adaptor (push hard until you feel a click, rotate the TRV until display faces up)
- press the button on the top for 3 seconds (motor will turn, `21°` + `((•))` should be on the display)
- close the cover

To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `heat`, `sleep`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
