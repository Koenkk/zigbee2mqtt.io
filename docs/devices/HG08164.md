## Notes

### Pairing

1. Remove the battery compartmet cover on the back of the device (you may need to use a flat-head screw driver).
2. Press and hold the reset button for 6 seconds. The device enters pairing mode. The LED in the front blinks to indicate that.
3. Pairing happens automatically if zigbee2mqtt is accepting new devices.

### Battery value
If battery value is not showing in Zigbee2MQTT briefly pressing reset button AFTER device is fully paired usually resolves the issue.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
