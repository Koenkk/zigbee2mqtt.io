## Notes

### Late Energy Flow Bug

Some or all PJ-1203A suffer from a bug that causes the energy flow direction to be reported during the next cycle update. In parctice, that means that an incorrect direction is published during `update_frequency`frequency seconds after any transition between `producing` and `consuming`.

For each channel `x`, the option `late_energy_flow_x` attempts to solve that problem by delaying the publication of `power_x`, `current_x`, `power_factor_x` and `energy_flow_x` until the next update of `energy_flow_x`.

The attribute `timestamp_x` indicates when the power value was actually received from the device. This is typically `update_frequency` seconds before the publication time when the option `late_energy_flow_x` is enabled. It should be noted that this delay does not occur when the power value is zero because the energy flow datapoint is neither produced by the device nor needed to compute the sign.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `late_energy_flow_a`: Delay channel A publication until the next energy flow update (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `late_energy_flow_b`: Delay channel B publication until the next energy flow update (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `signed_power_a`: Report energy flow direction for channel A using signed power (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `signed_power_b`: Report energy flow direction for channel B using signed power (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `ac_frequency_calibration`: Calibrates the ac_frequency value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `ac_frequency_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for ac_frequency, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`
