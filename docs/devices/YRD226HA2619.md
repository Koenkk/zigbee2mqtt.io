* `expose_pin`: Expose pin of this lock in the published payload (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "LOCK"}` or `{"state": "UNLOCK"}`.
To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
This lock exposes a lock state which can be found in the published state under the `lock_state` property. It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value. The possible values are: `not_fully_locked`, `locked`, `unlocked`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pin code (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pin_code": {"user": VALUE, "user_type": VALUE, "user_enabled": VALUE, "pin_code": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"pin_code": ""}`.
- `user` (numeric): User ID to set or clear the pincode for 
- `user_type` (enum): Type of user, unrestricted: owner (default), (year|week)_day_schedule: user has ability to open lock based on specific time period, master: user has ability to both program and operate the door lock, non_access: user is recognized by the lock but does not have the ability to open the lock allowed values: `unrestricted`, `year_day_schedule`, `week_day_schedule`, `master`, `non_access`
- `user_enabled` (binary): Whether the user is enabled/disabled allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `pin_code` (numeric): Pincode to set, set pincode to null to clear 

### Action source name (enum)

To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"auto_relock_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `3600`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Sound volume (enum)
Sound volume of the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sound_volume` property.
