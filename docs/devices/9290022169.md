## Notes


### Pairing
Factory resetting a Hue bulb can be accomplished in 4 ways.
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

#### Touchlink factory reset
See [Touchlink](../information/touchlink)

#### Hue bridge
When the bulb is still connected to the Hue bridge, you can simply factory reset the bulb
by removing it from the bridge via the Hue app. Orphaned bulbs (configured to connect to a non-existing zigbee network) can be adopted by a Hue bridge by entering the 6 character serial number in the Philips Hue app.

#### Hue dimmer switch
[VIDEO: Factory reset a Hue bulb with Hue dimmer switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).

#### TRADFRI remote control
This may also be possible with the
[Tradfri Remote Control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/tradfri-remote-control__0489469_PE623665_S4.JPG)
by pressing and holding the reset button on the bottom of the remote (next to the battery).
[This may not always work, even if the Hue bulb starts flashing](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/296#issuecomment-416923751).


### Power-on behavior
Allows to set the power-on behavior of the plug/bulb.
Note that this requires at least November/December '18 firmware update of the device.
```js
{
    "hue_power_on_behavior": "on",          // default, on, off, recover
    "hue_power_on_brightness": 125,         // same values as brightness
    "hue_power_on_color_temperature": 280,  // same values as color_temp
    "hue_power_on_color": "#0000FF",        // color in hex notation, e.g. #0000FF = blue

}
```

Attribute Value | Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------------
default         | reset to factory default value
on              | bulb on after power loss with configured brightness, color-temperature and color
off             | bulb off after power loss
recover         | last running state after power loss

Rules:
- `hue_power_on_behavior` value always has to be provided
- `hue_power_on_brightness`, `hue_power_on_color_temperature` and `hue_power_on_color` can only be provided when `hue_power_on_behavior` = `on`
- `hue_power_on_color_temperature` and `hue_power_on_color` cannot be provided together, only one can be set
- When setting `hue_power_on_behavior` = `on`, any not provided values will be reset to their factory defaults


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


* `hue_correction`: (optional) Corrects hue values based on a correction map for matching color
rendition to other lights. Provide a minimum of 2 data sets in the correction map. To build a map:
    * choose one of your other lights to be the color reference
    * send a sample color to both lights (reference and non-reference)
    * modify hue value for non-reference light until it color matches the reference light
    * take note of the in and out values, where
        * `in` is the hue value you sent to your reference light
        * `out` is the hue value you had to dial your non-reference light to
    * repeat with a few other sample colors (4-5 should suffice)

    **Example correction map:**
    ```yaml
    hue_correction:
        - in: 28
            out: 45
        - in: 89
            out: 109
        - in: 184
            out: 203
        - in: 334
            out: 318
    ```


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    color_temp: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
