### Pairing
Pair the sensor to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button 4 times in a row.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times and then turn off.
After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off.

### Binding
The E1745 can be bound to groups using [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md).
<!-- Notes END: Do not edit below this line -->


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `occupancy_timeout`: Time in seconds after which occupancy is cleared after detecting it (default 90 seconds). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`

* `illuminance_below_threshold_check`: Set to false to also send messages when illuminance is above threshold in night mode (default true). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported..
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Requested_brightness_level (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_level` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `76` and the maximum value is `254`.

### Requested_brightness_percent (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_percent` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `30` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Illuminance_above_threshold (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected bright light (works only in night mode).
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_above_threshold` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` illuminance_above_threshold is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
