## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the sensor to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button 4 short times.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times and then turn off. After a couple of seconds it will turn on again and pulsate to indicate that the pairing is in process. When connected, the light turns off.

A long press of 10 seconds on the pair button will enter the Zigbee Light Link (ZLL) pairing mode. Use this if you don't want to pair the device to Zigbee2MQTT and instead to a smart light bulb directly. 

### Binding
#### Warning! You need to activate the motion sensor and then immediately press bind in the Zigbee2MQTT interface. If the sensor is sleeping the bind will fail. credits: [issue #3831](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/3831)
The E1745 can be bound to groups. Although it is not possible to set the groupID at which the E1745 sends messages. But you can watch out in the log files for following debug messages:

```
debug Received Zigbee message from 'device', type 'commandOnWithTimedOff', cluster 'genOnOff', data '{"ctrlbits":0,"offwaittime":0,"ontime":600}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 123
```

Now you can create a group with a groupID of 123 and add your devices that should receive the message.

### occupancy_timeout option
Setting occupancy_timeout option to a value of fewer than 90 seconds will clear the occupancy flag, but will leave the sensor unresponsive till 90 seconds elapse. credits: [issue #13259](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/13259)

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a with a maximum value of `30`

* `occupancy_timeout`: Time in seconds after which occupancy is cleared after detecting it (default 90 seconds). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`

* `illuminance_below_threshold_check`: Set to false to also send messages when illuminance is above threshold in night mode (default true). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Illuminance above threshold (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected bright light (works only in night mode).
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_above_threshold` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` illuminance above threshold is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Requested brightness level (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_level` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `76` and the maximum value is `254`.

### Requested brightness percent (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_percent` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `30` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Identify (enum)
Initiate device identification. This device is asleep by default.You may need to wake it up first before sending the identify command..
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"identify": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `identify`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.
