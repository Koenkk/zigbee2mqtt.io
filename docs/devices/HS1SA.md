## Notes


### Pairing

Press the side button of the device with a paper clip for more than 2 seconds. The main button led will flash rapidly. Then make sure the device is awake during pairing phase or the configuration may fail. To ensure device is awake press the side button every 2 seconds until configuration is done in Zigbee2MQTT logs.

### Reset

If you have trouble pairing, the device can be reset by pressing the side button with a paper clip for 5 seconds. The led will flash (slower than in pairing mode) 6 times to confirm. After that you can retry the normal pairing procedure.

### Important
There are 3 versions of this device: Standalone, Zigbee and Z-wave. These are visually identical. Make sure to get the correct version that will work with Zigbee2MQTT:

Supported:
- **HS1SA-M : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-N : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-E : Zigbee 3.0**

Unsupported:
- HS1SA : Standalone
- HS1SA-Z : Z-wave

The product code should end in *-M* for the Zigbee version. The label inside the battery compartment should also show the Zigbee logo.

### Issue with regular (false) alarm notifications

If your smoke detector is regularily signalling an alarm over Zigbee (every 1-2 days), without actually making any alarm sound, it is probably affected by a firmware bug. This can be worked around as follows:

1. Open the device in the Z2M web interface
2. Navigate to the Dev console
3. Select the cluster `ssIasZone` from the dropdown list
4. Select the attributes `zoneState`, `zoneType`, `zoneStatus` and `zoneId`
5. Click the *Read* button
5. Wake the device immediately after pressing the *Read* button by pressing it's main button (test alarm button).

Timing is important here so you might need a fews tries. Once you have read these attributes successfully the false alarm messages should be gone. ([Source](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/5824#issuecomment-1092089211))
