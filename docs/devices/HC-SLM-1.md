To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
This lock exposes a lock state which can be found in the published state under the `lock_state` property. It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value. The possible values are: `not_fully_locked`, `locked`, `unlocked`.

### Battery (numeric)

The possible values are: `silent_mode`, `low_volume`, `high_volume`.

### Auto relock time (numeric)
The number of seconds to wait after unlocking a lock before it automatically locks again. 0=disabled.
