## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Energy (numeric)
Sum of consumed energy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `energy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `kWh`.

### Battery low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Pulse configuration (numeric)
Pulses per kwh. Default 1000 imp/kWh. Range 0 to 65535.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pulse_configuration` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"pulse_configuration": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pulse_configuration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `65535`.

### Interface mode (enum)
Operating mode/probe.
Value can be found in the published state on the `interface_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"interface_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"interface_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `electricity`, `gas`, `water`, `kamstrup-kmp`, `linky`, `IEC62056-21`, `DSMR-2.3`, `DSMR-4.0`.

### Current summation (numeric)
Current summation value sent to the display. e.g. 570 = 0,570 kWh.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_summation": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `268435455`.

### Check meter (binary)
Is true if communication problem with meter is experienced.
Value can be found in the published state on the `check_meter` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` check meter is ON, if `false` OFF.
