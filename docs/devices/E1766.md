## Notes


### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```

### Pairing
Pair the switch to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button (found under the back cover next to the battery)
4 times in a row. The red light on the front side should flash a few times and then turn off
(it's more visible to see the light from the back). After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate.
When connected, the light turns off.

### Actions
A `close` or `open` action is triggered when the corresponding button is pressed. 
If subsequently held down for > 0.5s, a `stop` action is triggered upon release.

### Binding
The [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md) functionality of this remote varies per firmware version:
- below 2.3.075: suppports binding to groups only. It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from. This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind` payload `{"from": "DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME", "to": "default_bind_group"}`. Wake up the device right before sending the commands by pressing a button on it.
- 2.3.075 and greater: supports binding to devices only

### Starting OTA updates
Press the button on it right before hitting the update button in Z2MA, and again every second or two for about 5 seconds until upgrade begin.
