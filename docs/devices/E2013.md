::: warning Known Issues with This Device

The IKEA PARASOLL door/window sensor is known to suffer from serious usability issues in some Zigbee networks, resulting in some sensors regularly going unavailable / draining their battery.

Whether this issue will affect you appears to depend on the other devices / routers in your Zigbee network, though the exact devices causing this issue have not been confirmed. Further discussion and investigation is available in the GitHub issue: [zigbee2mqtt#22579](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/22579)

In the meantime, **it is generally not recommended to buy PARASOLL sensors specifically for use with a Zigbee2MQTT network**.
