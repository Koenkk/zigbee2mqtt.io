### Documentation
Official documentation by Paulmann is available on their shop site. Check the "*Advice & Downloads*" section here: https://en.paulmann.com/detail/d6cceca46d334842bd3bd2008204274c

### Factory Reset (needed before pairing)
In order to pair the remote you first need to do a factory reset.
1. Hold the "Power" button for 5 seconds until the top LED stays active
2. Press the "Power" button 5 times in a row (make sure each press is confirmed via the LED on top)
3. The top LED should now blink 3 times confirming the reset

### Pairing
If this is the first time unpacking the remote, simply remove the battery protector on the back and enable pairing on Zigbee2MQTT, the remote should automatically try to pair.  
If the remote has already been paired once, you first need to do a factory reset (see above), otherwise it might refuse to pair.
1. Hold the "Power" button for 5 seconds until the top LED stays active
2. Press the "Fire" button once, the top LED should now be flashing rapidly
3. Allow joining on Zigbee2MQTT

### Troubleshooting

#### Zigbee2MQTT doesn't react to button presses
The remote might become unresponsive after ~10 minutes and refuses to send out commands. In this case a full factory reset (see section **Factory Reset** above) and re-pairing (see section **Pairing** above) should fix this issue.

#### Only the first selected group receives commands
This seems to be a firmware quirk of the Gent 2, when multiple groups are enabled at the bottom (e.g., 1 and 3) only the first active group (in this example 1) will receive commands. There is currently no fix for this issue unless a firmware update by Paulmann is released.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `toggle`, `brightness_move_to_level`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`, `brightness_stop`, `color_temperature_move_stop`, `color_temperature_move_up`, `color_temperature_move_down`, `color_temperature_step_up`, `color_temperature_step_down`, `enhanced_move_to_hue_and_saturation`, `move_to_hue_and_saturation`, `color_hue_step_up`, `color_hue_step_down`, `color_saturation_step_up`, `color_saturation_step_down`, `color_loop_set`, `color_temperature_move`, `color_move`, `hue_move`, `hue_stop`, `move_to_saturation`, `move_to_hue`, `recall`, `store`, `add`, `remove`, `remove_all`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
