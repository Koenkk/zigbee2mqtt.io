# Custom devices (DiY) ptvo.switch

| Model | ptvo.switch  |
| Vendor  | Custom devices (DiY)  |
| Description | [Multi-channel relay switch](https://ptvo.info/zigbee-switch-configurable-firmware-router-199/) |
| Supports | hold, single, double and triple click, on/off, type, rssi |
| Picture | ![Custom devices (DiY) ptvo.switch](../images/devices/ptvo.switch.jpg) |

## Notes


### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `true` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!)


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
