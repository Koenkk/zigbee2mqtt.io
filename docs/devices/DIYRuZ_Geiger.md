Current count radioactive pulses per minute.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radioactive_events_per_minute` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `rpm`.

### Radiation dose per hour (numeric)
Current radiation level.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radiation_dose_per_hour` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `μR/h`.

### Led feedback (binary)
Enable LED feedback.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_feedback` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_feedback": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_feedback": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` led feedback is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Buzzer feedback (binary)
Enable buzzer feedback.
Value can be found in the published state on the `buzzer_feedback` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"buzzer_feedback": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"buzzer_feedback": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` buzzer feedback is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Alert threshold (numeric)
Critical radiation level.
Value can be found in the published state on the `alert_threshold` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"alert_threshold": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alert_threshold": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10000`.
The unit of this value is `μR/h`.

### Sensors type (enum)
Type of installed tubes.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensors_type` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sensors_type": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensors_type": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `СБМ-20/СТС-5/BOI-33`, `СБМ-19/СТС-6`, `Others`.

### Sensors count (numeric)
Count of installed tubes.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensors_count` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sensors_count": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensors_count": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `50`.

### Sensitivity (numeric)
This is applicable if tubes type is set to other.
