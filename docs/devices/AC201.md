## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `system_mode`, `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `occupied_cooling_setpoint`, `ac_louver_position`, `local_temperature`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `8` and `30`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `occupied_cooling_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_cooling_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `8` and `30`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_cooling_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`, `cool`, `auto`, `dry`, `fan_only`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.

### Fan 
The current state of this fan is in the published state under the `fan_state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this fan publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fan_state": "ON"}` or `{"fan_state": "OFF"}`.
To read the current state of this fan publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"fan_state": ""}`.
To change the mode publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fan_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` can be: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `on`, `auto`.
