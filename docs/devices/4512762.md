## Notes
### Batteries not included
The manual does not mention the fact that the device comes without batteries. Remove the bottom lid and insert a CR2450 battery.

### Pairing
1. Short press the button on the bottom of the device (black, recessed button) three times in short succession.
2. A light on the top of the device should turn orange for a short while before it starts pairing.
3. If the light blinks slowly in green for five minutes, this indicates that the device is already paired, and must be factory reset before joining a new network. Refer to the section "Factory Reset" below.

### Factory Reset
1. Press and hold the button on the bottom of the device (black, recessed button) for ten seconds.
2. A light on the top of the device will start blinking red for ten seconds and then turn steadily red. You can now release the button, and the device will be reset when the light turns off.
