## Notes

### Pairing

There are 3 reset methods:
- press any switch 10 times  
(counts correctly, depends on switch-type)
- press and hold the side button for 10s
- power-cycle 5 times

Resetting removes the device from Z2M and puts it in pairing mode (blinking blue LED), but keeps user configuration (switch-type and power-on-behavior).
