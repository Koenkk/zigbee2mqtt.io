### Pairing

To Reset the iCasa ICZB-KPD18S do the following:
1) Press and hold down both OFF button and the ON button until the LED indicator on the remote turns on.
2) Than immediately click OFF button 5 times. 3) The LED status indicator flashes 3 times to indicate successful reset.

Pairing mode:
1) Press and hold down OFF and ON button simultaneously until the status LED indicator on the remote turns on,
then immediately click ON button.
2) The status LED indicator on the remote will blink fast.
3) When the pairing is successful the status LED indicator on the remote will blink 6 times.

### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```


### Legacy integration
By default (for backwards compatibility purposes) the legacy integration is enabled.
For new users it is recommended to **disable** this as it has several fundamental problems.
To disable the legacy integration add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    legacy: false
```

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
