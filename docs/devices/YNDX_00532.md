## Options

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Switch (1 endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_1` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_1": "ON"}`, `{"state_1": "OFF"}` or `{"state_1": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_1": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Switch (2 endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_2` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_2": "ON"}`, `{"state_2": "OFF"}` or `{"state_2": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_2": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Power-on behavior (enum, 1 endpoint)
Controls the behavior when the device is powered on after power loss.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_on_behavior_1` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_on_behavior_1": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_on_behavior_1": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `off`, `on`, `toggle`, `previous`.

### Power-on behavior (enum, 2 endpoint)
Controls the behavior when the device is powered on after power loss.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_on_behavior_2` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_on_behavior_2": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_on_behavior_2": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `off`, `on`, `toggle`, `previous`.

### Power type (enum)
Power supply type.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_type` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_type": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_type": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `full`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Operation mode (enum, 1 endpoint)
Switch mode (control_relay - the button control the relay, decoupled - button send events when pressed).
Value can be found in the published state on the `operation_mode_1` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"operation_mode_1": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"operation_mode_1": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `control_relay`, `up_decoupled`, `decoupled`, `down_decoupled`.

### Operation mode (enum, 2 endpoint)
Switch mode (control_relay - the buttons control the relay, decoupled - buttons send events when pressed).
Value can be found in the published state on the `operation_mode_2` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"operation_mode_2": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"operation_mode_2": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `control_relay`, `up_decoupled`, `decoupled`, `down_decoupled`.

### Led indicator (binary)
Led indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_indicator` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_indicator": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_indicator": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` led indicator is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on_b1_up`, `on_b1_down`, `on_b2_up`, `on_b2_down`, `off_b1_up`, `off_b1_down`, `off_b2_up`, `off_b2_down`, `toggle_b1_up`, `toggle_b1_down`, `toggle_b2_up`, `toggle_b2_down`.
