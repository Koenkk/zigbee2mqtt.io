## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset by removing the plastic cover and press & hold the power button for 10 seconds. The LED is then
starting to blink Red/Blue to indicate in pairing mode.

### Should automatically support (only tested Kamstrup)
- Aidon
- Kaifa
- Kamstrup

### Configuring interface mode
There should be no need to configure into any interface mode as the Eva HAN should autodetect the correct mode.

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. If firmware are < 0.4
either update fw via Eva Smart HUB or ask Datek for a replacement with min fw 0.4. Tested on 0.4.
