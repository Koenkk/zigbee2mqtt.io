## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset by removing the plastic cover and press & hold the power button for 10 seconds. The LED is then
starting to blink Red/Blue to indicate in pairing mode.

### Should automatically support (only tested Kamstrup)
- Aidon
- Kaifa
- Kamstrup

### Configuring interface mode
There should be no need to configure into any interface mode as the Eva HAN should autodetect the correct mode.

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. If firmware are < 0.4
either update fw via Eva Smart HUB or ask Datek for a replacement with min fw 0.4. Tested on 0.4.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
