## Notes
### Factory resetting
To factory reset the device, press and hold the only button until the red light starts blinking continuously. The device will reset and become available for pairing again.

The technical manual from Develco states that SMSZB-120 scans Zigbee channels 11-24 when searching for a network to join.

### Warning usage
Warning only support a single mode, `burglar`

Duration of using `warning` can be shorter than `max_duration` but not longer. If `max_duration` are set to 60 seconds, and you try to set `warning` with `duration` of 90 seconds, the warning will only apply for 60 seconds. Default value of `max_duration` are 240 seconds

This device do not support the `strobe` and `strobe_duty_cycle` functionality


### Triggering alarm (using old style `warning`)
This smoke alarm can be triggered manually by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with the payloads:

To start :
* `{"warning":{"duration":60,"level":"low","mode":"burglar","strobe":false,"strobe_duty_cycle":0}}`
Where:
- `duration`: the number of seconds the alarm will be on
- `level`: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `mode`: `stop`, `burglar`
- `strobe`: not supported
- `strobe_duty_cycle`: not supported

To stop:
* `{"warning":{"duration":60,"level":"low","mode":"stop","strobe":false,"strobe_duty_cycle":0}}`

### Triggering alarm, Simple
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alarm": "START"}` and `{"alarm": "OFF"}`
Set `max_duration` from the Zigbee2MQTT UI or by publishing `{"max_duration": NEW_VALUE}`
This alarm are preset to highest volume

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`
