# Develco SMSZB-120

| Model | SMSZB-120  |
| Vendor  | Develco  |
| Description | Smoke detector with siren |
| Supports | smoke, warning, temperature |
| Picture | ![Develco SMSZB-120](../images/devices/SMSZB-120.jpg) |

## Notes


### Triggering alarm
This smoke alarm can be triggered manually by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set` with the payloads:

To start (Change `duration` in number of seconds to what you need):
* `{"warning": {"mode": "burglar", "level": "high", "strobe": false, "duration": 300}}`

To stop:
* `{"warning": {"mode": "stop", "level": "low", "strobe": false, "duration": 300}}`

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
