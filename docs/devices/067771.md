## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


### Model numbers
Model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices, for instance:

- French models are branded as Céliane with Netatmo, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "0 677 21", "0 677 71" and "0 648 91".

- Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "7 418 10", "7 418 40" and "7 418 70".

### LED configuration
* `permanent_led`: enable or disable the permanent blue LED. Values: `ON` / `OFF` (default)
* `led_when_on`: enables the LED when the light is on. Values: `ON` / `OFF` (default)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable permanent LED and enable LED when the lights are on. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "permanent_led": "OFF",
    "led_when_on": "ON"
}
```

### Dimmer
* `dimmer_enabled`: enable or disable the dimming functions. Values: `ON` / `OFF` (default)

Example of MQTT message payload to enable dimming. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```
{
    "dimmer_enabled": "ON"
}
```

### Identify
Helps to identify the switch using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the switch. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
  "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
  }
}
```



## Exposes

### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.

#### Transition
For all of the above mentioned features it is possible to do a transition of the value over time. To do this add an additional property `transition` to the payload which is the transition time in seconds.
Examples: `{"brightness":156,"transition":3}`, `{"color_temp":241,"transition":1}`.

#### Moving/stepping
Instead of setting a value (e.g. brightness) directly it is also possible to:
- move: this will automatically move the value over time, to stop send value `stop` or `0`.
- step: this will increment/decrement the current value by the given one.

The direction of move and step can be either up or down, provide a negative value to move/step down, a positive value to move/step up.
To do this send a payload like below to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`

**NOTE**: brightness move/step will stop at the minimum brightness and won't turn on the light when it's off. In this case use `brightness_move_onoff`/`brightness_step_onoff`
````js
{
  "brightness_move": -40, // Starts moving brightness down at 40 units per second
  "brightness_move": 0, // Stop moving brightness
  "brightness_step": 40 // Increases brightness by 40
}
````

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
