## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### State (binary)
Turn the thermostat ON/OFF.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` state is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `fan_mode`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `45`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `cool`, `heat`, `fan_only`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9` and the maximum value is `9` with a step size of `0.1`.

### Deadzone temperature (numeric)
The difference between the local temperature that triggers heating and the set temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `deadzone_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"deadzone_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`.
Besides the numeric values the following values are accepted: `default`.

### Min temperature (numeric)
Minimum temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `min_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"min_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `15`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Max temperature (numeric)
Maximum temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `35` and the maximum value is `45`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Manual mode (binary)
Manual = Manual or Schedule = Auto.
Value can be found in the published state on the `manual_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"manual_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `Auto` manual mode is ON, if `Manual` OFF.
