## Notes


### Green Power
This is a Zigbee Green Power device which allows it to be very energy efficient.
Messages from Green Power devices cannot be "understood" by normal Zigbee devices, therefore they need to be "translated" first.
Not all Zigbee devices can do this translation. The devices known to do this are Philips Hue devices and some Ikea Tradfri bulbs (for example [LED2107C4](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/LED2107C4.html) is confirmed to work). This means that the Green Power device has to be in range of one of these devices in order to use it.

Green Power devices don't support binding and are not included in network scans.

### Pairing
Before starting a pairing attempt, please read carefully this section from the **[documentation ](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/zigbee/01_zigbee_network.html#green-power-devices)**

This device has 4 buttons:

| Number | Button | Position | Channel |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | A0 | Top left     | 15 |
| 2 | A1 | Bottom left  | 20 |
| 3 | B0 | Top right    | 11 |
| 4 | B1 | Bottom right | 25 |

In case the module is integrated in a single rocker switch, you need to remove the caps to expose all buttons. A button can be pressed by holding the contact of that button and then push the energy bar.

To pair it, hold the corresponding button for that channel for 7 seconds or more.

Once the device is paired you need to confirm the channel. To do this press A1 and B0 together. Important: don't press any other buttons between this and the pairing.

In case you want to pair it to a different channel you have to factory reset the device. This can be done by pressing all buttons (A0, A1, B0 and B1) simultaneously for at least 7 seconds.

Alternatively, you should be able to reset the switch with the following pattern:
1. Press top left (A0)
2. Press and hold top right (B0) for about 10 seconds 
3. press top right (B0) and bottom left (A1) at the same time 
4. press top left (A0)
Note: Please make sure the module is positioned the right way up.

## Home Assistant
The user, vandalon, over at the Home Assistant community forum has made a nice Automation Blueprint that works well with this device: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-enocean-ptm-215z-friends-of-hue-switch/429770
It adds functionality like `held_#` which is nice to use to for example increase or decrease the brightness of a light.
