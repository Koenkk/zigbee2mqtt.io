## Notes

### Calibration
You can calibrate your device (to enable position support) by closing the shutter (or opening it if your cover 
position is inverted) and pressing both the up and down buttons for about 5 seconds until you see a blinking yellow 
light. The shutter will begin calibrating itself and will open and close a few times (this process takes a few 
minutes to complete).  To initiate calibrate using Z2M (rather than the buttons), perform the following steps:
* Ensure that the device is fully joined to the Z2M coordinator (green light solid, *not* flashing)
* Use the device's 'Exposes' page in Z2M to set the calibration mode (typically 'specific_nllv').  If it is already in the desired calibration mode, switch to a different calibration mode,
  wait a few seconds, then switch back.
* The LED should start flashing orange.  Nothing will happen immediately - this is OK.  Wait a few minutes, then the device will automatically lower the cover, wait a few minutes, then raise it
  again (or maybe do some other calibration steps depending upon your setup)
* The LED will stop flashing orange once calibration is complete (might take up to 5 minutes total)

### Model number
Model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices.
French models are branded as Céliane with Netatmo, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "0 677 26A", "0 677 76A" and "0 648 96A".
Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next, and models for this device depends on the colour, with the following numbers: "7 418 07A", "7 418 37A" and "7 418 67A".

### Variants
There is a variant of this device that is an internal module (i.e. not a switch) with model "0 676 97".  It only has two buttons (one for 'setup', the other that will toggle
between raising and lowering the cover while that button is held down).  Because it does not have separate up and down buttons, it is unknown how to force a calibration on this device
(however see the calibration section above for details on how to calibrate using Z2M).

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `invert_cover`: Inverts the cover position, false: open=100,close=0, true: open=0,close=100 (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `cover_position_tilt_disable_report`: Do not publish set cover target position as a normal 'position' value (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `identity_effect`: Defines the identification effect to simplify the device identification. Example:
```yaml
identity_effect:
  effect: blink 3 # allowed: 'blink 3', 'fixed', 'blink green', 'blink blue'
  color: red # allowed: 'default', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'lightblue', 'yellow', 'pink', 'white'
```


## Exposes

### Cover 
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "OPEN"}`, `{"state": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `moving`, `identify`.

### Identify (enum)
Blinks the built-in LED to make it easier to identify the device.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"identify": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `identify`.

### Led in dark (binary)
Enables the built-in LED allowing to see the switch in the dark.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_in_dark` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_in_dark": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_in_dark": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` led in dark is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Led if on (binary)
Enables the LED on activity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_if_on` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_if_on": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_if_on": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` led if on is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Calibration mode (enum)
Defines the calibration mode of the switch. (Caution: Changing modes requires a recalibration of the shutter switch!).
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `classic_nllv`, `specific_nllv`, `up_down_stop`, `temporal`, `venetian_bso`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
