## Notes
You can calibrate your device (to enable position support) by closing the shutter (or opening it if your cover 
position is inverted) and pressing both the up and down buttons for about 5 seconds until you see a blinking yellow 
light. The shutter will begin calibrating itself and will open and close a few times (this process takes a few 
minutes to complete).
