## Notes


### Pairing 

The pinhole is a single hole (other side has 3).

To reset, use the pin tool (or any SIM removal tool) to hold down the pinhole for 5 seconds.  When successful, the led will start flashing green slowly 6 times.

To get into pairing mode, use the pin tool to hold down the pinhole for 3 seconds. The led will start flashing quickly. When the led is on for 3 seconds, the pairing is successful. When pairing is not successful, keep the sensor close to the adapter.

### Meaning of tamper
The tamper is triggered to `true` when a small black button underneath the battery compartment is no longer pressed down by the battery lid.
