# Lidl HG06336

| Model | HG06336  |
| Vendor  | Lidl  |
| Description | Silvercrest smart window and door sensor |
| Exposes | contact, battery_low, tamper, battery, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Lidl HG06336](../images/devices/HG06336.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Use the pin tool (or any SIM removal tool) to hold down the reset pinhole for 5 seconds.
This is the side with a single hole (other side has 3) When you let go, the led will start flashing green.
After setting pair mode the sensor will automatically connect.
While pairing, keep the sensor close to the adapter.

### Meaning of tamper
The tamper is triggered to `true` when a small black button underneath the battery compartment is no longer pressed down by the battery lid.



## Exposes

### Contact (binary)
Indicates if the contact is closed (= true) or open (= false).
Value can be found in the published state on the `contact` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `false` contact is ON, if `true` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
