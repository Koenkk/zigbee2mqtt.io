## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `co2_calibration`: Calibrates the co2 value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### CO2 (numeric)
Measured value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `co2` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Battery low (binary)
Empty battery indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Uptime (numeric)
Uptime.
Value can be found in the published state on the `uptime` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Hours`.

### Report delay (numeric)
Setting the sensor report delay. Setting the time in seconds (20-1800), by default 60 seconds.
Value can be found in the published state on the `report_delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"report_delay": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `20` and the maximum value is `1800`.
The unit of this value is `sec`.

### Forced recalibration (binary)
Start FRC (Perform Forced Recalibration of the CO2 Sensor).
Value can be found in the published state on the `forced_recalibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"forced_recalibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` forced recalibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Manual forced recalibration (numeric)
Start Manual FRC (Perform Forced Recalibration of the CO2 Sensor).
Value can be found in the published state on the `manual_forced_recalibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"manual_forced_recalibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `5000`.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Automatic scal (binary)
Automatic self calibration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `automatic_scal` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"automatic_scal": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` automatic scal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Factory reset co2 (binary)
Factory Reset CO2 sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `factory_reset_co2` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"factory_reset_co2": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` factory reset co2 is ON, if `OFF` OFF.
