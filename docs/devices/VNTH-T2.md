## Exposes

### Child lock (lock)
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `child_lock` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": "LOCK"}` or `{"child_lock": "UNLOCK"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Window detection (switch)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `window_detection` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"window_detection": "ON"}`, `{"window_detection": "OFF"}` or `{"window_detection": "TOGGLE"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Window open (binary)
Indicates if window is open.
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_open` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` window open is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `preset`, `running_state`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device, in the `heat` mode the TS0601 will remain continuously heating, i.e. it does not regulate to the desired temperature. If you want TRV to properly regulate the temperature you need to use mode `auto` instead setting the desired temperature.. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `heat`, `auto`, `off`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `manual`, `schedule`, `eco`, `comfort`, `antifrost`, `holiday`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9` and the maximum value is `9` with a step size of `0.5`.

### Away mode (switch)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `away_mode` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"away_mode": "ON"}`, `{"away_mode": "OFF"}` or `{"away_mode": "undefined"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Temperature sensitivity (numeric)
