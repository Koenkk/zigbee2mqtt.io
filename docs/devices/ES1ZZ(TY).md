## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Presence state.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Target distance (numeric)
Distance to target.
Value can be found in the published state on the `target_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Motion detection distance (numeric)
Motion detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_detection_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_detection_distance": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Presence keep time (numeric)
Presence keep time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_keep_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `min`.

### Motion detection sensitivity (numeric)
Motion detection sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_detection_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_detection_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `5`.

### Static detection sensitivity (numeric)
Static detection sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `static_detection_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"static_detection_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `5`.

### Fading time (numeric)
Time after which the device will check again for presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fading_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fading_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10000`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Led indicator (binary)
LED Presence Indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_indicator` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_indicator": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` led indicator is ON, if `false` OFF.
