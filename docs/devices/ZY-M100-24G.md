## Notes

The standard firmware of this device sends reports every second. This behaviour is not configurable, and can easily [overwhelm the Zigbee network and cause problems for other devices](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/19045). A solution to this is to reflash the device with a modified firmware that does not have this problem. Check https://github.com/Andrik45719/ZY-M100 for such a firmware, and instructions on how to flash the device.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### State (enum)
Presence state.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `presence`, `move`.

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Distance (numeric)
Target distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Motion sensitivity (numeric)
Motion sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Presence sensitivity (numeric)
Presence sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Max range (numeric)
Maximum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1.5` and the maximum value is `5.5`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Presence timeout (numeric)
Presence timeout.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_timeout` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_timeout": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `1500`.
The unit of this value is `s`.
