## Notes


### Pairing
Press the Orange button on the side until 3 dots appear on the screen.

### Compatibility issue

This device freeze after a while when not connected with a Tuya Hub. See [#7535](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/7535). Some users report that
this device work fine when connected to any hub through a relay device.

### Usage limitation

The device reports illuminance variations instantly. Therefore temperature is reported each hour making this device useless for building a thermostat.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `illuminance_raw`: Expose the raw illuminance value. The value must be `true` or `false`
