## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Large motion detection sensitivity (numeric)
Motion detection sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `large_motion_detection_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"large_motion_detection_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `x`.

### Large motion detection distance (numeric)
Motion detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `large_motion_detection_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"large_motion_detection_distance": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Motion state (enum)
State of the motion.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `huge`, `gigantic`.

### Fading time (numeric)
For how much time presence should stay true after detecting it.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fading_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fading_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `28800`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Medium motion detection distance (numeric)
Medium motion detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `medium_motion_detection_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"medium_motion_detection_distance": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `6`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Medium motion detection sensitivity (numeric)
Medium motion detection sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `medium_motion_detection_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"medium_motion_detection_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `x`.

### Indicator (binary)
LED Indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `indicator` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"indicator": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` indicator is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Small detection distance (numeric)
Small detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `small_detection_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"small_detection_distance": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `6`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Small detection sensitivity (numeric)
