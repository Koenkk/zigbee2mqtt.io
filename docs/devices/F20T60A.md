## Notes


### Pairing
This device ONLY works on channel 11. Once configured on channel 11, put your network in join mode and the device (steady red light) will auto join it.


### Force read power
* `power`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get`:

```js
{
    "power"
}
```


### Power Alarm Configuration
* `power_alarm`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: `DISABLE` (default) / `integer` (in kWh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
```

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kWh. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
```

When it reaches that value, the `power_alarm_active` binary_sensor will change to `true`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
    }
}
```

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for current, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `identity_effect`: Defines the identification effect to simplify the device identification. Example:
```yaml
identity_effect:
  effect: blink 3 # allowed: 'blink 3', 'fixed', 'blink green', 'blink blue'
  color: red # allowed: 'default', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'lightblue', 'yellow', 'pink', 'white'
```

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Device mode (enum)
switch: allow on/off, auto will use wired action via C1/C2 on contactor for example with HC/HP.
Value can be found in the published state on the `device_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"device_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"device_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `switch`, `auto`.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Power-on behavior (enum)
Controls the behavior when the device is powered on after power loss. If you get an `UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE` error, the device does not support it..
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_on_behavior` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_on_behavior": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_on_behavior": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `off`, `on`, `toggle`, `previous`.

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"voltage": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Current (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current.
Value can be found in the published state on the `current` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"current": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
