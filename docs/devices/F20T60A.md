# BTicino F20T60A

| Model | F20T60A  |
| Vendor  | BTicino  |
| Description | DIN power consumption module |
| Exposes | power, power_alarm_active, linkquality |
| Picture | ![BTicino F20T60A](../images/devices/F20T60A.jpg) |

### Force read power
* `power`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get`:

```js
{
    "power"
}
```


### Power Alarm Configuration
* `power_alarm`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: `DISABLE` (default) / `integer` (in kwh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
```

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kwh. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
```

When it reaches that value, the `power_alarm_active` binary_sensor will change to `true`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
    }
}
```



## Exposes
### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Power_alarm_active (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_alarm_active` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_alarm_active": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` power_alarm_active is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"
    icon: "mdi:flash"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power_alarm_active }}"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
