# CentraLite 3400-D

| Model | 3400-D  |
| Vendor  | CentraLite  |
| Description | 3-Series security keypad |
| Exposes | battery, temperature, action, linkquality |
| Picture | ![CentraLite 3400-D](../images/devices/3400-D.jpg) |

## Notes


### (Dis)arming
To (dis)arm the keypad send to `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
    "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode "arm_all_zones" or "disarm"
    }
}
```

### (Dis)arming from the keypad
When an attempt for (dis)arm is done on the keypad, Zigbee2MQTT will publish the following payload to topic `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME`:

```js
{
    "action": "arm_all_zones", // OR "disarm" when being disarmed
    "action_code": "123", // The code being entered
    "action_zone": 0, // The zone being (dis)armed (always 0)
    "action_transaction": 99 // The transaction number
}
```

In case you want to confirm this action (e.g. `action_code` value is OK), respond to it by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
    "transaction": 99, // Transaction number (take this value from the (dis)arm attempt property `action_transaction`)
    "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode "arm_all_zones", "disarm" or "invalid_code" (take this value from the (dis)arm attempt property `action`)
    }
}
```



## Exposes
### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `arm_night_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `invalid_code`, `emergency`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
    device_class: "temperature"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
