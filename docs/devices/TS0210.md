# TuYa TS0210

| Model | TS0210  |
| Vendor  | TuYa  |
| Description | Vibration sensor |
| Exposes | battery, vibration, sensitivity, linkquality |
| Picture | ![TuYa TS0210](../images/devices/TS0210.jpg) |

## Notes

None


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Vibration (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected vibration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `vibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` vibration is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Sensitivity (enum)
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    state_class: "measurement"

    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.vibration }}"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    device_class: "vibration"

    options: 
      - "low"
