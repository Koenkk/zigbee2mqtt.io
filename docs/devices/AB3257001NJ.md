### Pairing
For the OSRAM Smart+ plug (AB3257001NJ) hold the on/off button until your hear a click (+- 10 seconds).

### Caveats
Does not pass every attribute when acting as the routing parent for some end devices which send messages right after each other.

See also [#2274](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2274), note that the no occupancy for the Xiaomi RTCGQ11LM has been fixed.
