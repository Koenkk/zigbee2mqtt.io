## Notes

### Pairing
The device can be set to pairing mode by removing the device's back cover. There is a small "setup" button next to the battery which must be pressed for a few seconds by using a paperclip or something similar, which will bring the device into pairing mode. If this is a brand new device, hold button 1 for 3 sec to pair. If this does not work, holding down the top left (#1) button for approximately five seconds may put the device into pairing mode.

### Binding
By default, the device is bound to the coordinator, but it can also be used to directly control other lights and switches in the network (see [guide on binding](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/binding.html) and [guide on scenes](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/scenes.html)). This device can only recall scenes on groups, not individual lights, so if you only want to set scenes for a single light, you will need to add it to a group¹ (see below).

As the device is sleeping by default, you will need to wake it up after sending the bind/unbind command by pressing any button.

When endpoint `1` is bound to a light or a group of lights, the behavior is as follows:
| Button      | Click  | Action         | Comment |
|-------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Dimmer ring | Rotate | Set Brightness | This can also be used to turn on (but not off) the bound light or group. If controlling a group, this sets the brightness of all lights in the group to the same value. |
| Single dot  | Single | Recall Scene 1 | |
| Two dots    | Single | Recall Scene 0 | |
| Three dots  | Single | Recall Scene 5 | |
| Four dots   | Single | Recall Scene 4 | |
| Any dots    | Long   | All lights off | All scene buttons behave the same way, and will turn off all lights in the group if controlling a group. |

¹The groupID is particular to the specific device. To obtain the groupID and set up the binding, you need to follow these steps:

- turn on debug level logging in Zigbee2MQTT.
- make sure dimmer is paired.
- in Bind settings for the dimmer, unbind everything not `Scenes` and bind `Scenes` cluster between dimmer and coordinator.
- in logs filter for `scene` as the amount of debug messages is very high.
- press any scene button on the remote.
- you will see a debug level message looking like `debug 2025-03-11 11:00:52z2m: Received Zigbee message from 'Dimmer - Bathroom', type 'commandRecall', cluster 'genScenes', data '{"groupid":14719,"sceneid":0}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 14719`
- this will be slightly different for your device, read your specific `groupID`.
- create a group with this `groupID` and add the lights you want to bind to the switch to this group.
- save scenes in this group, one for each scene button.  These must be using sceneIDs `1`, `0`, `5` and `4` as above.
- bind the switch to the newly created group with matching `groupID` making sure `Scenes` cluster is also bound.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
