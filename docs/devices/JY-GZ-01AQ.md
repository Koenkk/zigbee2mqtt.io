To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"smoke": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` smoke is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Smoke density (numeric)
Value of smoke concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `smoke_density` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"smoke_density": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Smoke density dbm (numeric)
Value of smoke concentration in dB/m.
Value can be found in the published state on the `smoke_density_dbm` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"smoke_density_dbm": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `dB/m`.

### Selftest (enum)
Starts the self-test process (checking the indicator light and buzzer work properly).
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"selftest": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `selftest`.

### Test (binary)

Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"buzzer": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `mute`, `alarm`.
