### Configuring interface mode
In order to get measurements, after pairing the device you need to configure the interface mode.

To do this send to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload `{"interface_mode": "INTERFACE_MODE"}`.

Possible values for `INTERFACE_MODE` are:

| Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `norwegian_han` | Norwegian HAN  |
| `norwegian_han_extra_load` | Norwegian HAN â€“ Enable extra load. This is need to enable Adion meter communication |
| `aidon_meter` | Aidon Meter supporting Norwegian HAN HW interface. SW protocol is Aidon Manufacture Specific |
| `kaifa_and_kamstrup` | Kaifa meter and Kamstrup meters running old firmware |

Example of payload: `{"interface_mode": "norwegian_han_extra_load"}`

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. You can ask Wattle for a replacement.
