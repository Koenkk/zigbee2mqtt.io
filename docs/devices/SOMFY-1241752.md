## Notes
### Pairing
Use a paperclip to press and hold the programming button until the motor jogs twice.  
For more information, see [documentation](https://asset.somfy.com/Document/c2c8f7f2-d075-4af7-9b57-544cc97da65c_5157264_Sonesse%20ULTRA%2030%20WF%20Zigbee%20Li-ion.pdf) from SOMFY.

### Setting limits
Currently not possible over Zigbee. Enable the Bluetooth radio by using a paper clip to press the set button five times. Use the Set & Go [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/set-go-connect/id1450506599) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.somfy.setandgo&hl=en_US&gl=US) application to set up and down stop limits.

### Factory Reset 
Use paperclip to press and hold the programming button until the motor jogs three times.

### Battery level
Battery percentage level is reported, it may take some time for this to come through.

### OTA Update
The devices are claiming Zigbee support for over-the-air updates but I don't have sufficient information on this to give it a go. If you have any documentation, please get in touch @nonodename.
