## Notes

### Pairing
To start pairing, press the button (pinhole on the side of the device) using a
pin/paperclip for approx. 10 seconds. The led will turn on, then start blinking while the
pairing process is in progress.

### Reading and Setting Values

As a low power device, the motion sensor isn't reachable most of the time, but
only when active (e.g. because it detected motion). Therefore, requests to read
or set values (i.e. `sensitivity` or `keep_time`) will only work when the sensor detects motion.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Sensitivity (enum)
PIR sensor sensitivity (refresh and update only while active).
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Keep time (enum)
PIR keep time in seconds (refresh and update only while active).
Value can be found in the published state on the `keep_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keep_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `10`, `30`, `60`, `120`.

### Illuminance interval (numeric)
Brightness acquisition interval (refresh and update only while active).
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_interval` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"illuminance_interval": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `720`.
The unit of this value is `minutes`.
