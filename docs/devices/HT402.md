## Notes

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: auto_publish_outdoor_temp
  description: publish the outdoor temperature to Stelpro thermostat
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.outdoor_sensor_temperature
      condition: []
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data_template:
      payload: '{{ states(trigger.entity_id) }}'
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/THERMOSTAT_FRIENDLY_NAME/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature'
```

**IMPORTANT**: The outdoor temperature need to be refreshed at least each 4 hours, or the `EXT` display will be cleared on the thermostat.

### Reseting the energy value
The max energy value is `500` and there is no way to reset it manually since direct writes are not permitted. This value is automatically reset by the thermostat itself at midnight. To set the time on the thermostats so that they can perform the reset at midnight, we have to replicate the Hilo gateway behavior that sends a broadcast like this one every minute:
```
Frame 593: Packet, 55 bytes on wire (440 bits), 55 bytes captured (440 bits)
IEEE 802.15.4 Data, Src: 0x7eed, Dst: Broadcast
ZigBee Network Layer Data, Dst: Broadcast, Src: 0x0000
ZigBee Application Support Layer Data, Dst Endpt: 255, Src Endpt: 1
    Frame Control Field: Data (0x08)
    Destination Endpoint: 255
    Cluster: Time (0x000a)
    Profile: Home Automation (0x0104)
    Source Endpoint: 1
    Counter: 89
ZigBee Cluster Library Frame, Command: Report Attributes, Seq: 46
    Frame Control Field: Profile-wide (0x08)
    Sequence Number: 46
    Command: Report Attributes (0x0a)
    Attribute Field, Uint32: 821194320
        Attribute: Local Time (0x0007)
        Data Type: 32-Bit Unsigned Integer (0x23)
        Uint32: 821194320 (0x30f26e50)
```

This can be achieved by publishing a properly crafted message to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/action` using a script like this one:

```yaml
action: mqtt.publish
metadata: {}
data:
  qos: "1"
  payload: >-
    {% set zigbee_epoch = (as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00')) | int %}
        {
            "action": "raw",
            "params": {
                "network_address": 65532,
                "dst_endpoint": 255,
                "src_endpoint": 1,
                "profile_id": 260,
                "cluster_key": 10,
                "zcl": {
                    "frame_type": 0,
                    "direction": 1,
                    "disable_default_response": true,
                    "command_key": 10,
                    "payload": [
                        {
                            "attrId": 7,
                            "dataType": 35,
                            "attrData": {{ zigbee_epoch }}
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
  topic: zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/action
```

Triggering this script every minute might not be necessary, but triggering it multiple times few miniutes before and after midnight might be a good idea, just to make sure the thermostats have the proper time set and notice the day change.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `thermostat_unit`: Controls the temperature unit of the thermostat (default celsius). The value must be one of `celsius`, `fahrenheit`
