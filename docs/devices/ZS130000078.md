## Notes

### General

Once the device is turned on, it usually publishes some status messages to z2m that look like this:

```
info  2022-02-18 19:20:02: MQTT publish: topic 'zigbee2mqtt/LinkindKeypad', payload '{"ac_status":false,"battery":100,"battery_low":false,"linkquality":32,"occupancy":false,"restore_reports":true,"smoke":false,"supervision_reports":true,"tamper":true,"test":false,"trouble":false,"voltage":3000}'
```

Here it should give you already an overview about the linkquality, battery etc. If nothing is happening after turning on, check your z2m and hardware setup again and retry.

The keypad has a proximity sensor builtin, which turns on the light of the keys and LEDs whenever your hand gets close to it and signals this with a beep as well. At this stage, there is not much you can do with the keypad. Pressing any button has no effect and usually the network LED is blinking orange. After a couple of seconds the keypad gives up and gets back into standby. This repeats until you will pair it and initialize it properly like described below.

In general, once properly setup, the current arm mode on the keypad is shown, by highlighting one of the (dis)arm buttons on the right with a greenish color.

### Pairing

In order to pair the keypad with z2m, simply use a paperclip and stick it to the small hole on the back of the keypad and hold it for a couple of seconds until the network LED is blinking green quickly. You find the hole in the area where the wallmounting clip will be placed. Now watch the logs for z2m to see the keypad being interviewed, configured and finally detected as Linkind Keypad device:

Zigbee2MQTT:info  2022-02-16 23:26:21: MQTT publish: topic 'zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event', payload '{"data":{"friendly_name":"0x588e81fffe21eede","ieee_address":"0x588e81fffe21eede"},"type":"device_joined"}'

Zigbee2MQTT:info  2022-02-16 23:26:26: MQTT publish: topic 'zigbee2mqtt/bridge/event', payload '{"data":{"friendly_name":"0x588e81fffe21eede","ieee_address":"0x588e81fffe21eede"},"type":"device_announce"}'

Zigbee2MQTT:info  2022-02-16 23:26:42: Successfully interviewed '0x588e81fffe21eede', device has successfully been paired
Zigbee2MQTT:info  2022-02-16 23:26:42: Device '0x588e81fffe21eede' is supported, identified as: Linkind Security keypad battery (ZS130000078)
```
As you can see it can happen that it fails a couple of times - then simply wait and retry if needed. 

### Initialize after pairing

Once the keypad is successfully paired, it will still show the behavior like explained in the general section above. In order to properly initialize it, you have to send the following payload to the MQTT topic you created for it appending `/set`:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
        "mode": "disarm"
    }
}
```

This will set the keyboard into disarmed mode, ready to be used as it should be. Now you can actually press one of the (dis)arm buttons on the right, enter a code and press the check symbol. Then you should see a payload containing the action mode, transaction and code.

Whenever you stop z2m, you have to re-send the payload above in order to init it again. I haven't tried it, but maybe sending the actual arm mode state from the service could also work.

### Arming/Disarming from the server
To set arming mode publish the following payload to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` topic:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
        "mode": "arm_all_zones"
    }
}
```
Valid `mode` values as per ZCL specifications are `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `arm_night_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `exit_delay`, `entry_delay`, `not_ready`, `in_alarm`, `arming_stay`, `arming_night`, `arming_away`.
### Arming/Disarming from the keypad
When an attempt to set arm mode is done on the keypad, Zigbee2MQTT will publish the following payload to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME`:

```js
{
    "action": "arm_all_zones", // This is the example
    "action_code": "123", // The code being entered
    "action_zone": 0, // The zone being armed (always 0)
    "action_transaction": 99 // The transaction number
}
```

The automation server must validate the request and send a notification to the keypad, confirming or denying the request.

Do so by sending the following payload to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
        "transaction": 99, // Transaction number (this must be the same as the keypad request `action_transaction`)
        "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode (this must be the same as the keypad request `action`)
    }
}
```
Valid `mode` values are `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `invalid_code`, `not_ready`, `already_disarmed`

The automation server must follow the notification with an actual change to the correct arm mode. For the example above, the server should respond with `exit_delay`, count the elapsed time (e.g 30 secs), then change mode again to `arm_all_zones` (see "Arming/Disarming from the server" section above)
