### Pairing
If pairing failed, try the followings:
- Make sure door are in open state
- Press and hold manual lock button and wait for 3 beeps
- Keypad in front lights up
- Type inn the Master PIN, then *, then 2, then *, then 0
Lock will now reset the Zigbee module and go to pairing mode

### PIN Code Usage
To retrieve the state, send a `get` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/get`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`. To set, send a `set` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1,"pin_code":1234}}`. To clear a code, send a `set` message with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`
