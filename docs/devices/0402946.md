## Notes


### Pairing
If pairing failed, try the followings:
- Make sure door are in open state
- Press and hold manual lock button and wait for 3 beeps
- Keypad in front lights up
- Type inn the Master PIN, then *, then 2, then *, then 0
Lock will now reset the Zigbee module and go to pairing mode

### PIN Code Usage
To retrieve the state, send a `get` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/get`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`. To set, send a `set` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1,"pin_code":1234}}`. To clear a code, send a `set` message with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `expose_pin`: Allows to retrieve the `pin_code` value, rather than just user status (`available`/`enabled`), for `pin_code` endpoints (default: `false`) in `devices.yaml`.

Example:
{% raw %}
```yaml
'0x680ae2fffe6bb522':
  friendly_name: '0x680ae2fffe6bb522'
  expose_pin: true
```
{% endraw %}

## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "LOCK"}` or `{"state": "UNLOCK"}`.
To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
This lock exposes a lock state which can be found in the published state under the `lock_state` property. It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value. The possible values are: `not_fully_locked`, `locked`, `unlocked`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pin_code (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pin_code": {"user": VALUE, "user_type": VALUE, "user_enabled": VALUE, "pin_code": VALUE}}`
- `user` (numeric): User ID to set or clear the pincode for. 
- `user_type` (enum): Type of user, unrestrictied: owner (default), (year|week)_day_schedule: user has ability to open lock based on specific time period, master: user has ability to both program and operate the door lock, non_access: user is recognized by the lock but does not have the ability to open the lock. Allowed values: `unrestricted`, `year_day_schedule`, `week_day_schedule`, `master`, `non_access`
- `user_enabled` (binary): Whether the user is enabled/disabled. Allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `pin_code` (numeric): Pincode to set, set pincode to null to clear. 

### Sound_volume (enum)
Sound volume of the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sound_volume` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sound_volume": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sound_volume": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `silent_mode`, `low_volume`, `high_volume`.

### Master_pin_mode (binary)
Allow Master PIN Unlock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `master_pin_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"master_pin_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"master_pin_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` master_pin_mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Rfid_enable (binary)
Allow RFID to Unlock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `rfid_enable` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"rfid_enable": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"rfid_enable": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` rfid_enable is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Relock_enabled (binary)
Allow Auto Re-Lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `relock_enabled` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"relock_enabled": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"relock_enabled": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` relock_enabled is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Lock_mode (enum)
Lock-Mode of the Lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `lock_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"lock_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"lock_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `auto_off_away_off`, `auto_on_away_off`, `auto_off_away_on`, `auto_on_away_on`.

### Service_mode (enum)
Service Mode of the Lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `service_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"service_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"service_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `deactivated`, `random_pin_1x_use`, `random_pin_24_hours`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration

manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
