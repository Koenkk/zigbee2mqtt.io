## Exposes

### Cover 
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "OPEN"}`, `{"state": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Cover mode (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"cover_mode": {"reversed": VALUE, "calibration": VALUE, "maintenance": VALUE, "led": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"cover_mode": ""}`.
- `reversed` (binary): Reversal of the motor rotating direction allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `calibration` (binary): Set the cover calibration mode allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `maintenance` (binary): Set the cover maintenance mode, enabling will disable the cover motor allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `led` (binary): Set the LED allowed values: `true` or `false`

### Velocity (enum)
Velocity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `velocity` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"velocity": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"velocity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `slow`, `normal`, `fast`.

### Max position (numeric)
Max position.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_position` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"max_position": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_position": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Min position (numeric)
Min position.
Value can be found in the published state on the `min_position` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"min_position": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"min_position": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.
