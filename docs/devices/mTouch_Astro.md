## Options

## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`.

### Device mode (enum)
Device mode..
Value can be found in the published state on the `device_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `astro_clock`, `timer`, `daily_timer`, `weekly_timer`.

### Device enabled (binary)
Turn the device on or off.
Value can be found in the published state on the `device_enabled` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"device_enabled": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"device_enabled": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` device enabled is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Child lock (binary)
Physical input on the device enabled/disabled.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `locked` child lock is ON, if `unlocked` OFF.

### Group id (numeric)
The device sends commands with this group ID. Put devices in this group to control them..
Value can be found in the published state on the `group_id` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
