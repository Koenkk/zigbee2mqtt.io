## Notes

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature
  description: Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload: '{{ states(''sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor'') | string }}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
    service: mqtt.publish
```

### Setting the clock
To set thermostat display clock, you need to send an epoch value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
```

On pairing of the device, the time will be set to the network time. Afterwards, the thermostat does not update with network time change, like DST.

An empty payload will set time to current network time. 

If you want to automate setting the clock using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Set_Thermostat_Time'
  alias: Auto_Set_Thermostat_Time
  description: Automatically set time thermostat time
  trigger:
    - platform: time
      at: "00:00:00"
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
        payload: ""
```

### Activate eco mode
To set the eco_mode, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/1/set
```
Different version of ecoMode exist :
- **ecoMode** : off:-128, celsius*+-10, amount of setpoint reduction/increase for peak and pre-heating or 0 only for the eco icon to flash
- **ecoMode1** : 255=100%, range: 0-99 Set pi_heating_demand percentage limit 0% to 99% (225 = 100%)
- **EcoMode2** : off:255, range: 0-100, set heating restart if room temperature goes x% below setpoint

If you want to enable the eco mode using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'activate_eco_mode'
  alias: Activate-eco_mode
  description: Do stuff for the eco mode
  trigger: []
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload: '{"write":{"cluster":"manuSpecificSinope","options":{},"payload":{"ecoMode":<VALUE>}}}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/1/set
    service: mqtt.publish
```

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for current, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`
