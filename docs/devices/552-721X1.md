## Notes

### Pairing
Remove the cover and press the little button 3x, the led will flash blue when in pairing mode. The device stays in this mode for 5 minutes or until it succesfully paired.

### Binding
This device does not support binding to groups or devices.

### Decoupling
This device does support decoupling from the build in relay, when the device is decoupled it will emit a 'single', 'hold', and 'release' action.

### LED
| LED | Description |
|-----|-----|
| off | normal operation, the load is off |
| white continues | normal operation, the load is on |
| red flashing | connection to the zigbee network lost |
| blue flashing | connecting to the zigbee network |
| blue continues for 4 sec | connected succesfully to the zigbee network |

The LED can be disabled while the load is on by using a toothpick and holding the **PROG** button for 10 seconds.

## Options

## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Operation mode (enum)
Value can be found in the published state on the `operation_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"operation_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"operation_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `control_relay`, `decoupled`.

### Action reporting (binary)
Enable Action Reporting.
Value can be found in the published state on the `action_reporting` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"action_reporting": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"action_reporting": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` action reporting is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Led enable (binary)
Enable LED.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_enable` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_enable": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_enable": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` led enable is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Led state (enum)
LED State.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_state` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_state": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_state": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `ON`, `OFF`, `Blue`, `Red`, `Purple`.

### Led sync mode (enum)
Sync LED with relay state.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_sync_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_sync_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_sync_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `Off`, `On`, `Inverted`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
