### Options (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"options": {"motor_speed": VALUE, "reverse_direction": VALUE}}`
- `motor_speed` (numeric): Motor speed max value is 255
- `reverse_direction` (binary): Reverse the motor direction allowed values: `true` or `false`

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
