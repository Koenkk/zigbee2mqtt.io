## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    min_temp: "7"
    max_temp: "30"
    modes: 
      - "off"
      - "auto"
      - "heat"
    mode_state_topic: true
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json.system_mode }}"
    mode_command_topic: true
    current_temperature_topic: true
    current_temperature_template: "{{ value_json.local_temperature }}"
    temperature_state_topic: true
    temperature_state_template: "{{ value_json.occupied_heating_setpoint }}"
    temperature_command_topic: "occupied_heating_setpoint"
    temp_step: 1
    action_topic: true
    action_template: "{{ value_json.operation }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
