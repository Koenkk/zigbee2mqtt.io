Plug the device in and wait for around 5mins, while it performs its self-tests.
A successful self-test is indicated by couple of beeps and a steady green led.
Now the device is ready for pairing. To initiate pairing quickly press the button three times in a row.


### Sensitivity
The sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
`{"sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITIVITY` is one of the following
values: `low`, `medium`,  `high`.

### Self-test
A self-test can be trigged by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
`{"selftest": ""}`.
If the selftest is executed successfully you will hear the device beep in 30 seconds.
