## Notes

### Pairing
To put the device in pairing mode, detach button covers and press pairing button for 5 seconds until LEDs start breathing animation, then release pairing button. When pairing process is completed, LEDs animation will stop.

### Factory reset
This device resets itself to factory settings when it is removed from the Zigbee network, and this removal is initiated by coordinator (i.e. via frontend or by sending command to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/remove` topic). If device is removed by pressing the pairing button (manual pairing), then its settings will remain intact.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets duration of identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long device would flash). Value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a with a maximum value of `30`
