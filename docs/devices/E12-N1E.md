## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


* `hue_correction`: (optional) Corrects hue values based on a correction map for matching color
rendition to other lights. Provide a minimum of 2 data sets in the correction map. To build a map:
    * choose one of your other lights to be the color reference
    * send a sample color to both lights (reference and non-reference)
    * modify hue value for non-reference light until it color matches the reference light
    * take note of the in and out values, where
        * `in` is the hue value you sent to your reference light
        * `out` is the hue value you had to dial your non-reference light to
    * repeat with a few other sample colors (4-5 should suffice)

    **Example correction map:**
    ```yaml
    hue_correction:
        - in: 28
            out: 45
        - in: 89
            out: 109
        - in: 184
            out: 203
        - in: 334
            out: 318
    ```


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    color_temp: true
    xy: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
