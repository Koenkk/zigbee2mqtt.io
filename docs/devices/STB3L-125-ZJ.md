## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Energy (numeric)
Sum of consumed energy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `energy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `kWh`.

### Fault (enum)
Fault status of the device (clear = nothing).
Value can be found in the published state on the `fault` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `clear`, `short_circuit_alarm`, `surge_alarm`, `overload_alarm`, `leakagecurr_alarm`, `temp_dif_fault`, `fire_alarm`, `high_power_alarm`, `self_test_alarm`, `ov_cr`, `unbalance_alarm`, `ov_vol`, `undervoltage_alarm`, `miss_phase_alarm`, `outage_alarm`, `magnetism_alarm`, `credit_alarm`, `no_balance_alarm`.

### Voltage a (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value (phase A).
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage_a` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Voltage b (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value (phase B).
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage_b` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Voltage c (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value (phase C).
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage_c` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Power a (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power (phase A).
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_a` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Power b (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power (phase B).
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_b` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Power c (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power (phase C).
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_c` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Current a (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current (phase A).
Value can be found in the published state on the `current_a` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Current b (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current (phase B).
Value can be found in the published state on the `current_b` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Current c (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current (phase C).
Value can be found in the published state on the `current_c` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Leakage test (binary)
Turn ON to perform a leagage test.
Value can be found in the published state on the `leakage_test` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"leakage_test": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` leakage test is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
