## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Presence timeout (numeric)
Presence timeout.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_timeout` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_timeout": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `180`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Move sensitivity (numeric)
sensitivity of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `move_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"move_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `X`.

### Move minimum range (numeric)
Movement minimum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `move_minimum_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"move_minimum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Move maximum range (numeric)
Movement maximum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `move_maximum_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"move_maximum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Breath sensitivity (numeric)
Breath sensitivity of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `breath_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"breath_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `X`.

### Breath minimum range (numeric)
Breath minimum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `breath_minimum_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"breath_minimum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Breath maximum range (numeric)
Breath maximum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `breath_maximum_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"breath_maximum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.
