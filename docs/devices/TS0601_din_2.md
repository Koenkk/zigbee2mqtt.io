## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for current, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Energy (numeric)
Sum of consumed energy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `energy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `kWh`.

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Current (numeric)
Instantaneous measured electrical current.
Value can be found in the published state on the `current` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `A`.

### Fault (enum)
Fault status of the device (clear = nothing).
Value can be found in the published state on the `fault` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `clear`, `over_current_threshold`, `over_power_threshold`, `over_voltage threshold`, `wrong_frequency_threshold`.

### Threshold 1 (enum)
State of threshold_1.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_1` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `not_set`, `over_current_threshold`, `over_voltage_threshold`.

### Threshold 1 protection (binary)
OFF - alarm only, ON - relay will be off when threshold reached.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_1_protection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `ON` threshold 1 protection is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Threshold 1 value (numeric)
Can be in Volt or Ampere depending on threshold setting. Setup the value on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_1_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Threshold 2 (enum)
State of threshold_2.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_2` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `not_set`, `over_current_threshold`, `over_voltage_threshold`.

### Threshold 2 protection (binary)
OFF - alarm only, ON - relay will be off when threshold reached.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_2_protection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `ON` threshold 2 protection is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Threshold 2 value (numeric)
Setup value on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `threshold_2_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Clear fault (binary)
Turn ON to clear last the fault.
Value can be found in the published state on the `clear_fault` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"clear_fault": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` clear fault is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Meter id (text)
Meter ID (ID of device).
Value can be found in the published state on the `meter_id` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
