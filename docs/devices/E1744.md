# IKEA E1744

| Model | E1744  |

## Notes


### Pairing
Press the button on the device 4 times (until the red light turns on).

### Binding
If you want to [bind](../information/binding.md) this remote directly to a group or light, bind cluster `LevelCtrl` only (**not** `LevelCtrl` and `OnOff`). If both clusters are bound, a click on the remote toggles the bound group or light twice, thus neither turning it on or off. Cluster-specific binding is most easily done in the [frontend](../information/frontend.md).


### Legacy integration
By default (for backwards compatibility purposes) the legacy integration is enabled.
For new users it is recommended to **disable** this as it has several fundamental problems.
To disable the legacy integration add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    legacy: false
```
{% endraw %}


The information below only applies to the legacy integration.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting `debounce` option with `debounce_ignore: - action` to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)

{% raw %}
```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
```
{% endraw %}

To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding `brightness` to `debounce_ignore` option

{% raw %}
```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness
```
{% endraw %}

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)


* `simulated_brightness`: Set to `true` to simulate a `brightness` value (default: `false`).
If this device provides a `brightness_move_up` or `brightness_move_down` action it is possible to specify the update
interval and delta. This can be done by instead of specifying `true`:

```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_stop`, `toggle`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    state_class: "measurement"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"
    enabled_by_default: true
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    enabled_by_default: false
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    state_class: "measurement"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:update"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['update']['state'] }}"
    enabled_by_default: false

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
    enabled_by_default: false
```
{% endraw %}
