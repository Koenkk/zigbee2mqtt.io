## Notes


### Pairing
Press the button on the device 4 times (until the red light turns on).

### Binding
If you want to [bind](../guide/usage/binding.md) this remote directly to a group or light, bind cluster `LevelCtrl` only (**not** `LevelCtrl` and `OnOff`). If both clusters are bound, a click on the remote toggles the bound group or light twice, thus neither turning it on or off. Cluster-specific binding is most easily done in the [frontend](../guide/configuration/frontend.md).


### Legacy integration
By default (for backwards compatibility purposes) the legacy integration is enabled.
For new users it is recommended to **disable** this as it has several fundamental problems.
To disable the legacy integration add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    legacy: false
```



The information below only applies to the legacy integration.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting `debounce` option with `debounce_ignore: - action` to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
```


To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding `brightness` to `debounce_ignore` option


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness
```

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a with a maximum value of `30`

* `legacy`: Set to false to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended), will change structure of the published payload (default true). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Identify (enum)
Initiate device identification. This device is asleep by default.You may need to wake it up first before sending the identify command..
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"identify": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `identify`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `toggle`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_stop`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
