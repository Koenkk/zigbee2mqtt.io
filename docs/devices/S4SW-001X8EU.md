## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Wi-Fi status (text)
Current connection status.
Value can be found in the published state on the `wifi_status` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"wifi_status": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### IP address (text)
IP address currently assigned to the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `ip_address` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"ip_address": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### DHCP enabled (binary)
Indicates whether DHCP is used to automatically assign network settings.
Value can be found in the published state on the `dhcp_enabled` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"dhcp_enabled": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` dHCP enabled is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Wi-Fi Configuration (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"wifi_config": {"enabled": VALUE, "ssid": VALUE, "password": VALUE, "static_ip": VALUE, "net_mask": VALUE, "gateway": VALUE, "name_server": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"wifi_config": ""}`.
- `enabled` (binary): Enable/disable Wi-Fi connectivity allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `ssid` (text): Name (SSID) of the Wi-Fi network to connect to 
- `password` (text): Password for the selected Wi-Fi network 
- `static_ip` (text): Manually assigned IP address (used when DHCP is disabled) 
- `net_mask` (text): Subnet mask for the static IP configuration 
- `gateway` (text): Default gateway address for static IP configuration 
- `name_server` (text): Name server address for static IP configuration
