# Airam AIRAM-CTR.U

| Model | AIRAM-CTR.U  |
| Vendor  | Airam  |
| Description | CTR.U remote |
| Supports | on/off, brightness up/down and click/hold/release |

## Notes


### Pairing
Hold small reset button pressed (located under battery cover on the backside of remote) for 4
seconds and device will reset and will attempt to join network.
Keep clicking any button on the frontside of the device to keep device awake while pairing.
You should be clicking every two seconds until pairing is complete.

Device seems to join network also when it is paired directly to Airam bulb (which is joined to network already)
(https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/4713407.html) by keeping ON and DIM buttons pressed while holding remote
within 5 centimeters away from Airam bulb.


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
