### Remote unlock
Be aware that this smart does not offer remote unlock. Users will need the special keys it provides. You can then disable access for these keys, but this requires the app. In essence Zigbee2MQTT only provides the ability to know when a key was inserted.
<!-- Notes END: Do not edit below this line -->




## Exposes

### Inserted (text)
Value can be found in the published state on the `inserted` property.
