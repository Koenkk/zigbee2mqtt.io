### Fully open and fully closed positions
The rotation range (fully open and fully closed) can be reset by holding the both the up and down buttons for 3 seconds until the light turns blue.

#### Fully open position
The fully open position can be set by setting the shade to the desired position and then pressing the up button 5 times in succession. If successful the light turns blue and flashes 3 times.

#### Fully closed position
The fully closed position can be set by setting the shade to the desired position and then pressing the down button 5 times in succession. If successful the light turns blue and flashes 3 times.
