|3|4|

### Pairing
To enter pairing mode hold button 3 (about 10 seconds) until all 4 LEDs start flashing.
Note: When the battery is low, it will also flash all 4 leds, so if your pairing is failing, double check your battries.
### Device modes
This device has two modes:
1. dimmer mode
2. switch mode *(to have the 12 actions mentioned below)*

To switch between modes hold buttons 2+4 (about 6 seconds) until light 3 flashes once.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
