## Notes

### Adapter firmware
In order for this device to work, at least the following firmware is required on your adapter:
- CC2530/CC2531: [`20211115`](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/Z-Stack_Home_1.2_20211115/20211116/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin)
- CC1352/CC2652: [`20211114`](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/7c5a6da0c41855d42b5e6506e5e3b496be097ba3/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin)
- CC2538: [`20211222`](https://github.com/jethome-ru/zigbee-firmware/tree/master/ti/coordinator/cc2538_cc2592)
- Conbee II: [`0x26720700`]( http://deconz.dresden-elektronik.de/deconz-firmware/deCONZ_ConBeeII_0x26720700.bin.GCF)

*Note that if you have already paired the device you will need to repair it after upgrading your adapter firmware.*

### Pairing
Press and hold the reset button on the device for +- 5 seconds (until the blue light starts blinking).
After this the device will automatically join. If this doesn't work, try with a single short button press.

*Note: When you fail to pair a device, try replacing the battery, this could solve the problem.*

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `device_temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the device_temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `occupancy_timeout`: Time in seconds after which occupancy is cleared after detecting it (default is "detection_interval" + 2 seconds). The value must be equal to or greater than "detection_interval", and it can also be a fraction. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`

* `no_occupancy_since`: Sends a message the last time occupancy (occupancy: true) was detected. When setting this for example to [10, 60] a `{"no_occupancy_since": 10}` will be send after 10 seconds and a `{"no_occupancy_since": 60}` after 60 seconds. The value must be a list of [object Object].


## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Motion sensitivity (enum)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_sensitivity` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Detection interval (numeric)
Time interval for detecting actions.
Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_interval` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"detection_interval": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"detection_interval": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `2` and the maximum value is `65535`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Device temperature (numeric)
Temperature of the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `device_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Voltage of the battery in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mV`.

### Power outage count (numeric)
Number of power outages.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_outage_count` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
