## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Illuminance (numeric)

Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Sensitivity (numeric)
sensitivity of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`.

### Minimum range (numeric)

To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"minimum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Maximum range (numeric)
maximum detection range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `maximum_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"maximum_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Interval time (numeric)
interval_time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `interval_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"interval_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `3600`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Detection delay (numeric)
detection delay.
Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
