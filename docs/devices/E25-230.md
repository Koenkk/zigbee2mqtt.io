## Exposes

### State (binary)
Turn the thermostat ON/OFF.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` state is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `system_mode`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `running_state`, `preset`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `heat`, `cool`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `Manual`, `Frost`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`, `cool`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-3.5` and the maximum value is `3.5` with a step size of `0.5`.

### Control algorithm (enum)
Sets the control algorithim of the thermostat.
Value can be found in the published state on the `control_algorithm` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"control_algorithm": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `TPI_UFH`, `TPI_RAD`, `TPI_ELE`, `HIS_04`, `HIS_08`, `HIS_12`, `HIS_16`, `HIS_20`, `HIS_30`, `HIS_40`.

### Max temperature (numeric)
Maximum temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Min temperature (numeric)
Minimum temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `min_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"min_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Valve protection (binary)
Enable valve protection.
Value can be found in the published state on the `valve_protection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"valve_protection": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` valve protection is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Relay mode (enum)
Sets the internal relay function.
Value can be found in the published state on the `relay_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"relay_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `NO`, `NC`, `OFF`.

### Backlight (numeric)
Set the backlight brightness of the thermostat..
Value can be found in the published state on the `backlight` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"backlight": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Frost set (numeric)
Set the frost protection temperature..
Value can be found in the published state on the `frost_set` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"frost_set": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `17`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.
