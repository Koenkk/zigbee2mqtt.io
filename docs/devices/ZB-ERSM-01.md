## Notes

### Pairing
You have 3 possibilities of pairing:
- With Chacon/DiO radio controller (remote, switchâ€¦)
- With DiO mobile app via Bluetooth
- With Zigbee

* You can pair a DiO controller and Zigbee on the same device.
* You can pair a DiO controller and mobile app on the same device.
* But you cannot pair mobile app and Zigbee on the same device

### Calibration
1. Open the roller shutter entirely
2. Activate calibration mode
3. Close the shutter by pushing the "close" button every 0.5 seconds until the shutter is totally closed
4. Exit calibration mode (now the closing time is set)
5. Activate calibration mode again
6. Open the shutter by pushing the "open" button every 0.5 seconds until the shutter is totally open
7. Exit calibration mode (now the opening time is set, calibration is done)

**Caution**: _In calibration mode, any shutter movement command lasts 1 second maximum. For continuous movement, the Zigbee Down/Close command must be sent approximately every 0.5 seconds._

## Exposes

### Cover 
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "OPEN"}`, `{"state": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Cover mode (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"cover_mode": {"reversed": VALUE, "calibration": VALUE, "maintenance": VALUE, "led": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"cover_mode": ""}`.
- `reversed` (binary): Reversal of the motor rotating direction allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `calibration` (binary): Set the cover calibration mode allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `maintenance` (binary): Set the cover maintenance mode, enabling will disable the cover motor allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `led` (binary): Set the LED allowed values: `true` or `false`

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `open`, `close`, `stop`.
