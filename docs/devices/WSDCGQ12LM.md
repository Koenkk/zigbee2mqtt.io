## Notes

### Adapter firmware
In order for this device to work (fully), at least the following firmware is required on your adapter:
- CC2530/CC2531: [`20211115`](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/Z-Stack_Home_1.2_20211115/20211116/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin)
- CC1352/CC2652: [`20211114`](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/7c5a6da0c41855d42b5e6506e5e3b496be097ba3/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin)
- CC2538: [`20211222`](https://github.com/jethome-ru/zigbee-firmware/tree/master/ti/coordinator/cc2538_cc2592)
- Conbee II: [`0x26720700`]( http://deconz.dresden-elektronik.de/deconz-firmware/deCONZ_ConBeeII_0x26720700.bin.GCF)

*Note that if you have already paired the device you will need to repair it after upgrading your adapter firmware.*

### Pairing
Press and hold the reset button on the device for +- 5 seconds (until the blue light starts blinking).
After this the device will automatically join. If this doesn't work, try with a single short button press.

*Note: When you fail to pair a device, try replacing the battery, this could solve the problem.*

### Troubleshooting: device stops sending messages/disconnects from network
Since Xiaomi devices do not fully comply to the Zigbee standard, it sometimes happens that they disconnect from the network.
Most of the times this happens because of the following reasons:
- Device has a weak signal, you can see the signal quality in the published messages as `linkquality`. A linkquality < 20 is considered weak.
- Low battery voltage, this can even happen when the battery still appears full. Try a different battery.
- The device is connected through a router which cannot deal with Xiaomi devices. This is known to happen devices from: Centralite, General Electric, Iris, Ledvance, Legrand, OSRAM, Sylvania, SmartThings, Securifi. A possible solution is to connect the device directly to the central coordinator by pushing the reset button while being physically close to it.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `pressure_calibration`: Calibrates the pressure value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `pressure_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for pressure, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `device_temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the device_temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.
