## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold the reset button on the device for +- 5 seconds (until the blue light starts blinking).
After this the device will automatically join, but the interview process may not finish.
If that happens, keep doing short presses to the reset button to keep the light flashing, until the interview process finishes successfully.

### Recommendation
If the contact is being made via a horizontal slide (e.g. the sensor is placed at the top of a sliding door), the sensor may provide three or more messages with conflicting states. To get around this issue, consider using the `debounce` option in your device specific configuration.

E.g. (devices.yaml)


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_sensor
    debounce: 1
```
