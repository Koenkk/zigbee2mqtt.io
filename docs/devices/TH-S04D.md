## Notes

### Pairing
The device will ship with Thread firmware and in order to pair you will first need to swap it to a Zigbee Firmware.
To do this you must download the Aqara Home app and sign up.   The device should appear in the app (you may need to ignore attempts to set it up via Thread).
The device will page will state that the current protocol is Thread but ignore the button at the bottom and instead click the link to switch to Zigbee Protocol.

Once updated the device should be in pairing mode and can be added.   If it fails to add hold the reset button on the back until the signal strength bar starts flashing and the device will re-enter pairing mode.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a with a maximum value of `30`
