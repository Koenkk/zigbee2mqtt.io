## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `system_mode`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Whether the thermostat is turned on or off. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `auto`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.

### Boost (enum)
Override the schedule and boost at the current temperature until turned off.
Value can be found in the published state on the `boost` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"boost": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `ON`, `OFF`.

### Display brightness (numeric)
Brightness of the display when in use.
Value can be found in the published state on the `display_brightness` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"display_brightness": NEW_VALUE}`.

### Holiday start stop (numeric)
Set the number of days of holiday, this will start immediately..
Value can be found in the published state on the `holiday_start_stop` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"holiday_start_stop": NEW_VALUE}`.
