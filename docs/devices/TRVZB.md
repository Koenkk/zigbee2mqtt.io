### Pairing
To pair the device you first need to have it powered, attached to the valve and displaying the temperature.

If the device is showing `FS` or `RD` press the button on the top of the unit and it should now show `,,7`

Once this stops flashing hold the top button for about 5 seconds at which point the unit should now show the temperature.

Keep turning the dial counter-clockwise unil the display shows `OF` and finally hold down the top button for 3 seconds.

You should now see a flashing signal icon and it will try and pair.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `thermostat_unit`: Controls the temperature unit of the thermostat (default celsius). The value must be one of `celsius`, `fahrenheit`


## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `running_state`.

To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `4` and `35`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of the thermostat. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `auto`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.

The first transition for each day must start at 00:00 and the valid temperature range is 4-35°C (in 0.5°C steps). The temperature will be set at the time of the first transition until the time of the next transition, e.g. '04:00/20 10:00/25' will result in the temperature being set to 20°C at 04:00 until 10:00, when it will change to 25°C..
