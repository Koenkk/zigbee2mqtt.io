### Force read power
* `power`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/get`:

```js
{
    "power"
}
```


### Power Alarm Configuration
* `power_alarm`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: `DISABLE` (default) / `integer` (in kwh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
```

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kwh. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
```

When it reaches that value, the `power_alarm_active` binary_sensor will change to `true`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`:

```js
{
    "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
    }
}
```


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    icon: "mdi:flash"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power_alarm_active}}"
    device_class: "power"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
