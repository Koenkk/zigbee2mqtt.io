## Notes


### Model numbers
In Legrand, model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices, for instance:

- French models are branded as Céliane with Netatmo, whereas Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next. However, this device has no colour options, so there is only one model: "412015" or "4 120 15"

### Force read power
* `power`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get`:

```js
{
    "power"
}
```


### Power Alarm Configuration
* `power_alarm`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: `DISABLE` (default) / `integer` (in kWh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
```

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kWh. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
```

When it reaches that value, the `power_alarm_active` binary_sensor will change to `true`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
    }
}
```



## Exposes

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Power_alarm_active (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_alarm_active` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` power_alarm_active is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Power_alarm (binary)
Enable/disable the power alarm.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_alarm` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_alarm": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_alarm": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` power_alarm is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    device_class: "power"
    state_class: "measurement"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power_alarm_active }}"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false

switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{% if value_json.power_alarm %} true {% else %} false {% endif %}"
    payload_on: "true"
    payload_off: "false"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    command_topic_postfix: "power_alarm"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    enabled_by_default: false
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    state_class: "measurement"
```
{% endraw %}
