## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Water level (numeric)
Current water level in cm.
Value can be found in the published state on the `water_level` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Out of service (binary)
Level is out if service.
Value can be found in the published state on the `out_of_service` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `True` out of service is ON, if `False` OFF.

### Filling (numeric)
Tank filling.
Value can be found in the published state on the `filling` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Tank height (numeric)
Water tank height in cm.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tank_height` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"tank_height": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `450`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Alarm min threshold (numeric)
Min threshold for alarm binding.
Value can be found in the published state on the `alarm_min_threshold` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alarm_min_threshold": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Alarm max threshold (numeric)
Max threshold for alarm binding.
Value can be found in the published state on the `alarm_max_threshold` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"alarm_max_threshold": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Invert threshold (binary)
Invert thresholds for on and off commands.
Value can be found in the published state on the `invert_threshold` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"invert_threshold": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `True` invert threshold is ON, if `False` OFF.

### Measurment period (numeric)
Max threshold for alarm binding.
Value can be found in the published state on the `measurment_period` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"measurment_period": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `3600`.
The unit of this value is `min`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"battery": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Reported battery voltage in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
