## Notes


### Pairing

Hold the top 2 buttons (on and off) for about 5 seconds until the LED goes from solid green to blinking, then let go.

For more information, refer to the [LIDL manual](https://www.lidl-service.com/static/5027306530/334437_Zigbee_OS_DE_EN%20_FR_NL_PL_CS_SK.PDF).

### Direct Pairing with end device (like Livarno Lux ceiling light 14147206L)

If you have successfully paired the remote and compatible end device like Livarno Lux ceiling light, you can make direct pairing (binding)

1. Turn on end device (light)
2. Get close with the remote to the light max 30cm
3. Press and hold the ON button (or OFF to remove the direct pairing) on the remote and release it when the LED on the remote starts blinking
4. After a few seconds, the remote's LED stays on and the light starts to pulse. The pairing is done.

Note: Be sure to make a direct pairing after you pair both devices with Z2M.

### On Button

The "On" button sends the event only once. The remote remembers the last pressed button and ignores all consequent button presses. More info on the [issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/6509).

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `brightness_stop`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`.
