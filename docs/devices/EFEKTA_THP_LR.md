## Notes


### Build guide
Instructions on how to build this device can be found [here](https://github.com/smartboxchannel/Outdoor-long-range-sensor-for-temperature-humidity-and-atmospheric-pressure-Zigbee)

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


* `humidity_precision`: Controls the precision of `humidity` values, e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the humidity value set it to e.g. `{80: 0, 10: 1}`,
when humidity >= 80 precision will be 0, when humidity >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.


* `pressure_precision`: Controls the precision of `pressure` values, e.g. `0` or `1`; default `1`.
To control the precision based on the pressure value set it to e.g. `{1000: 0, 100: 1}`,
when pressure >= 1000 precision will be 0, when pressure >= 100 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `pressure_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate pressure values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 to the pressure reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.
