## Notes
This device can be setup in different modes: control, switch, sensors/blinds and scenes.

In switch mode, this device has a rather long internal debounce (waiting for 2x the switch flipped for 50% brightness, or
3x for 100% brightness). This causes a noteable delay before sending a e1_toggle or e2_toggle.

For a simple lights on/off scenario you can avoid this delay by putting the device into sensor mode, and call a lights
toggle function on both e1_on / e1_off actions.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on_e1`, `off_e1`, `toggle_e1`, `recall_*_e1`, `brightness_stop_e1`, `brightness_move_*_e1`, `on_e2`, `off_e2`, `toggle_e2`, `recall_*_e2`, `brightness_stop_e2`, `brightness_move_*_e2`, `close_cover`, `open_cover`, `stop_cover`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
