# Ubisys S1

| Model | S1  |
| Vendor  | Ubisys  |
| Description | Power switch S1 |
| Supports | on/off, power measurement |
| Picture | ![Ubisys S1](../images/devices/S1.jpg) |

## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the input(s) need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device (S1-R only, S1 only has one input)
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    icon: "mdi:flash"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
