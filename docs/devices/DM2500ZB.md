## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness, color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for current, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.

### Timer_seconds (numeric)
Automatically turn off load after x seconds.
Value can be found in the published state on the `timer_seconds` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"timer_seconds": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"timer_seconds": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10800`.

### Led_intensity_on (numeric)
Control status LED when load ON.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_intensity_on` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_intensity_on": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_intensity_on": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Led_intensity_off (numeric)
Control status LED when load OFF.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_intensity_off` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"led_intensity_off": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_intensity_off": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Minimum_brightness (numeric)
Control minimum dimmer brightness.
Value can be found in the published state on the `minimum_brightness` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"minimum_brightness": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"minimum_brightness": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `3000`.

### Led_color_on (composite)
Control status LED color when load ON.
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_color_on": {"r": VALUE, "g": VALUE, "b": VALUE}}`
- `r` (numeric) 
- `g` (numeric) 
- `b` (numeric) 

### Led_color_off (composite)
Control status LED color when load OFF.
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_color_off": {"r": VALUE, "g": VALUE, "b": VALUE}}`
- `r` (numeric) 
- `g` (numeric) 
- `b` (numeric) 

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
