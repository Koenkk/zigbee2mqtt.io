## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Temperature calibration (numeric)
Temperature calibration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_calibration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_calibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-10` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Temperature range (numeric)
Keep the temperature in a range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Auto work (binary)
Auto work mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `auto_work` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"auto_work": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` auto work is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Temperature target (numeric)
Temperature target.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_target` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_target": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-100` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Mode (enum)
Work mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `Heating`, `Cooling`.

### Delay (binary)
Switch delay time mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"delay": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` delay is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Delay time (numeric)
Switch delay time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `delay_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"delay_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `minute`.
