Value can be found in the published state on the `eco_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"eco_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` eco mode is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Sensor (enum)
Choose which sensor to use. Default: AL.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensor` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

The minimal value is `20` and the maximum value is `50`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `local_temperature`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `0` and `50`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9` and the maximum value is `9` with a step size of `1`.

### Max temperature limit (numeric)
