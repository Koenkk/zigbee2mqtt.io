Steps for resetting
1. Open the casing of the device
2. Press and hold the reset button for approximately 14-16 seconds.
3. While holding down the button, the LED first flashes once, then two times in a row, and finally numerous times in a row.
4. After a succesful reset, the yellow LED will start flashing which indicates network search.
