## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### State (enum)
Presence state sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `presence`, `move`.

### Presence (binary)
Occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Distance (numeric)
Target distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Illuminance sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Move sensitivity (numeric)
Motion Sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `move_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"move_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.

Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Detection distance min (numeric)
Minimum range.
Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_distance_min` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"detection_distance_min": NEW_VALUE}`.
