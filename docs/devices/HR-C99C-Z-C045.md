## Notes


### Pairing
Hold small reset button pressed (located on the backside of remote) for 3
seconds (until the front LED blinks) and device will reset and will attempt to join network.

### Actions generated by circular button
It is important to know that click on the center round boutton is the way to switch between
`color_saturation_step_down` and `color_temperature_step_up` (bottom of the cicrcular button) 
`color_saturation_step_up` and  `color_temperature_step_down` (top of the cicrcular button) 
`color_hue_step_down` and nothing (left of the cicrcular button)
`color_hue_step_up` and nothing (right of the cicrcular button)

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
