## Exposes

### Switch (bottom_left endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_bottom_left` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_bottom_left": "ON"}`, `{"state_bottom_left": "OFF"}` or `{"state_bottom_left": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_bottom_left": ""}`.

### Switch (bottom_right endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_bottom_right` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_bottom_right": "ON"}`, `{"state_bottom_right": "OFF"}` or `{"state_bottom_right": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_bottom_right": ""}`.

### Switch (top_left endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_top_left` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_top_left": "ON"}`, `{"state_top_left": "OFF"}` or `{"state_top_left": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_top_left": ""}`.

### Switch (top_right endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_top_right` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_top_right": "ON"}`, `{"state_top_right": "OFF"}` or `{"state_top_right": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_top_right": ""}`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `release_bottom_left`, `hold_bottom_left`, `release_bottom_right`, `hold_bottom_right`, `release_top_left`, `hold_top_left`, `release_top_right`, `hold_top_right`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
