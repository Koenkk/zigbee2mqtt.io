## Notes

### Arming/Disarming from the server
To set arming mode publish the following payload to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` topic:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
        "mode": "arm_all_zones"
    }
}
```
Valid `mode` values as per ZCL specifications are `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `arm_night_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `exit_delay`, `entry_delay`, `not_ready`, `in_alarm`, `arming_stay`, `arming_night`, `arming_away`.
### Arming/Disarming from the keypad
When an attempt to set arm mode is done on the keypad, Zigbee2MQTT will publish the following payload to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME`:

```js
{
    "action": "arm_all_zones", // This is the example
    "action_code": "123", // The code being entered
    "action_zone": 0, // The zone being armed (always 0)
    "action_transaction": 99 // The transaction number
}
```

The automation server must validate the request and send a notification to the keypad, confirming or denying the request.

Do so by sending the following payload to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
        "transaction": 99, // Transaction number (this must be the same as the keypad request `action_transaction`)
        "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode (this must be the same as the keypad request `action`)
    }
}
```
Valid `mode` values are `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `arm_night_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `invalid_code`, `not_ready`, `already_disarmed`

The automation server must follow the notification with an actual change to the correct arm mode. For the example above, the server should respond with `exit_delay`, count the elapsed time (e.g 30 secs), then change mode again to `arm_all_zones` (see "Arming/Disarming from the server" section above)

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `occupancy_timeout`: Time in seconds after which occupancy is cleared after detecting it (default 90 seconds). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`
