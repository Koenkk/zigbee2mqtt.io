### Pairing

To pair this device, remove the top cover from the main sensor and remove the battery.  Hold
the small tamper switch down for at least three seconds.  Continue holding down while you reinsert
the battery.  Once you release the tamper switch, the led next to it should come on and start blinking,
indicating that the device is ready to pair.
