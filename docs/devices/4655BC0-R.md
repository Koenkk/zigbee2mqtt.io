### Pairing

To pair this device, remove the top cover from the main sensor and remove the battery.  Hold
the small tamper switch down for at least three seconds.  Continue holding down while you reinsert
the battery.  Once you release the tamper switch, the led next to it should come on and start blinking,
indicating that the device is ready to pair.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
