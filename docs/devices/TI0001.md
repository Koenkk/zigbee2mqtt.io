## Notes


### Important
These devices can only be used on channel 26.
These devices are locked to the manufacturer's network key (ext_pan_id).
Your configuration file [data/configuration.yaml](../guide/configuration/) must contain the following:

```yaml
advanced:
  ext_pan_id: [33,117,141,25,0,75,18,0]
  channel: 26
```

Therefore these devices may not co-existence with other Zigbee devices.
Maybe, you need to add a dedicated coordinator and create a new network for Livolo.
If you decided to create a new network, you should specify another 'pan_id'.

```yaml
advanced:
  pan_id: 6756
```

To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_left": ""}`.

### Switch (right endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_right` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_right": "ON"}`, `{"state_right": "OFF"}` or `{"state_right": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_right": ""}`.

### Switch (bottom_left endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_bottom_left` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_bottom_left": "ON"}`, `{"state_bottom_left": "OFF"}` or `{"state_bottom_left": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_bottom_left": ""}`.

### Switch (bottom_right endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_bottom_right` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).

To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_bottom_right": ""}`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
