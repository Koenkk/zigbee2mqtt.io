## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `expose_device_state`: . The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `fan_mode`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `preset`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `cool`, `heat`, `fan_only`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `auto`, `manual`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9` and the maximum value is `9` with a step size of `1`.

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Max temperature (numeric)
Maximum temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `35` and the maximum value is `45`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Deadzone temperature (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `deadzone_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"deadzone_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Schedule text (text)
Weekly schedule in the format "HH:MM/TT HH:MM/TT ...".
Example for 12 segments:
"06:00/20 11:30/21 13:30/22 17:30/23 06:00/24 12:00/23 14:30/22 17:30/21 06:00/19 12:30/20 14:30/21 18:30/20".
Each segment contains:
- HH:MM: Time in 24-hour format.
- TT: Temperature in °C.
Ensure all 12 segments are defined and separated by spaces..
Value can be found in the published state on the `schedule_text` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"schedule_text": NEW_VALUE}`.
