## Exposes

### Child lock (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Sensor (enum)
Select temperature sensor to use.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensor` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensor": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `internal`, `external`, `both`.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `system_mode`, `preset`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `running_state`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `manual`, `auto`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9.9` and the maximum value is `9.9` with a step size of `0.1`.

### Backlight mode (enum)
Intensity of the backlight.
Value can be found in the published state on the `backlight_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"backlight_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `off`, `always_low`, `always_mid`, `always_high`.

### Frost protection (binary)
Antifreeze function.
Value can be found in the published state on the `frost_protection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"frost_protection": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` frost protection is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Max temperature limit (numeric)
Maximum upper temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature_limit` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature_limit": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `15` and the maximum value is `90`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.
Besides the numeric values the following values are accepted: `default`.

### Temperature delta (numeric)
The delta between local_temperature and current_heating_setpoint to trigger Heat.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature_delta` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"temperature_delta": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0.5` and the maximum value is `10`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.
Besides the numeric values the following values are accepted: `default`.

### Factory reset (binary)
Full factory reset, use with caution!.
Value can be found in the published state on the `factory_reset` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"factory_reset": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` factory reset is ON, if `OFF` OFF.
