## Warning: degrades network performance
AwoX devices are known to cause network instability. If your Zigbee network has poor performance or you are seeing errors like `NO_NETWORK_ROUTE` you should remove this device from the network.
It [may help](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/18366) to OTA update your device via the "AwoX HomeControl" app over Bluetooth.

## Upgrading FW
Before paring with Zigbee is good update FW of the remote controller via bluetooth. To do this install app "AwoX HomeControl" on your smarthopne, pair the device by holiding for 3s power on and blue button and accroding instruction in the app update FW. 

## Paring 
Set Zigbee2MQTT paring to enable and on remote controller push power on and coloured wheel, red LED indication in middle of the device should 3x flash (this clear memory pairing remote controller).  After that keep power on button 3s.   

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `red`, `refresh`, `refresh_colored`, `blue`, `yellow`, `green`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_stop`, `recall_1`, `color_temperature_step_up`, `color_temperature_step_down`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
