## Exposes

### Gas (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected gas.
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"gas": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` gas is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Gas density (numeric)
Value of gas concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas_density` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"gas_density": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%LEL`.

### Gas sensitivity (enum)
Gas concentration value at which an alarm is triggered ("10%LEL" is more sensitive than "15%LEL").
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas_sensitivity` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"gas_sensitivity": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"gas_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `10%LEL`, `15%LEL`.

### Selftest (enum)
Starts the self-test process (checking the indicator light and buzzer work properly).
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"selftest": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `selftest`.

### Test (binary)
Self-test in progress.
Value can be found in the published state on the `test` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` test is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Buzzer (enum)
The buzzer can be muted and alarmed manually. During a gas alarm, the buzzer can be manually muted for 10 minutes ("mute"), but cannot be unmuted manually before this timeout expires. The buzzer cannot be pre-muted, as this function only works during a gas alarm. During the absence of a gas alarm, the buzzer can be manually alarmed ("alarm") and disalarmed ("mute"), but for this "linkage_alarm" option must be enabled.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"buzzer": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `mute`, `alarm`.

### Buzzer manual alarm (binary)
Buzzer alarmed (manually).
Value can be found in the published state on the `buzzer_manual_alarm` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"buzzer_manual_alarm": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` buzzer manual alarm is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Buzzer manual mute (binary)
Buzzer muted (manually).
Value can be found in the published state on the `buzzer_manual_mute` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"buzzer_manual_mute": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` buzzer manual mute is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkage alarm (binary)
When this option is enabled and a gas alarm has occurred, then "linkage_alarm_state"=true, and when the gas alarm has ended or the buzzer has been manually muted, then "linkage_alarm_state"=false.
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkage_alarm` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"linkage_alarm": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"linkage_alarm": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` linkage alarm is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkage alarm state (binary)
"linkage_alarm" is triggered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkage_alarm_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` linkage alarm state is ON, if `false` OFF.

### State (binary)
"Preparation" or "work" (measurement of the gas concentration value and triggering of an alarm are only performed in the "work" state).
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `preparation` state is ON, if `work` OFF.

### Power outage count (numeric)
Number of power outages (since last pairing).
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_outage_count` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_outage_count": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
