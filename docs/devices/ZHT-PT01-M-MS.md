## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `preset`, `system_mode`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `30`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `comfort`, `comfort_1`, `comfort_2`, `eco`, `antifrost`, `program`, `thermostat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`, `auto`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-10` and the maximum value is `10` with a step size of `0.1`.
