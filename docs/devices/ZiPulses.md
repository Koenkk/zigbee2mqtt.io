## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)

The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Multiplier (numeric)
It is necessary to press the link button to update.
Value can be found in the published state on the `multiplier` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"multiplier": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `1000`.

### Divisor (numeric)
It is necessary to press the link button to update.
Value can be found in the published state on the `divisor` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"divisor": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `1000`.

### UnitOfMeasure (enum)
It is necessary to press the link button to update.
Value can be found in the published state on the `unitOfMeasure` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"unitOfMeasure": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `kWh`, `m3`, `ft3`, `ccf`, `US gl`, `IMP gl`, `BTUs`, `L (litre)`, `kPA (jauge)`, `kPA (absolu)`, `kPA (absolu)`, `sans unité`, `MJ`, `kVar`.
