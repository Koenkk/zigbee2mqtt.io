## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.

The possible values are: `on`, `off`, `toggle`, `brightness_step_up`, `brightness_step_down`, `color_temperature_move`, `color_move`, `brightness_stop`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_move_up`, `color_loop_set`, `enhanced_move_to_hue_and_saturation`, `scene_*`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
