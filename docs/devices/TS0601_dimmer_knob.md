## Notes

### Min/max brightness
Only 'min_brightness', but not 'max_brightness' is provided.

### Pairing
To pair the device, the knob must be pressed for 5 sec. Sometimes, the pairing mode works only, if the light is on. Additionally, it seems the device can only be paired directly to the coordinator, but not to routers.
