## Notes
### Pairing
* Short press (< 0.5 seconds) the upper left button three times.

### Resetting
* Short press (< 0.5 seconds) the upper left button three times and hold for 10
  seconds, until the LED blinks red. After releasing the LED will stop blinking
  once the device is reset.

### 1-channel vs 2-channel mode
Depending on the firmware version the device may support both 1-channel and 2-channel mode. In 1-channel mode both the upper and lower buttons
works as the upper buttons. On some firmware versions (incl. those sold as Elko EKO07117) the device starts out in 1-channel mode and must be
switched into 2-channel mode either by using the Elko / Wiser gateway or by holding down button 1 and 4 (upper left and lower right) for approx.
10 seconds - the led will flash red and the become green once successfull.

### Battery
The battery used is a standard CR2032. The battery can be replaced by pulling
off the button keys along with the horizontal bar in the middle of the switch.

### ELKO Smart
This device is also used by the EKO07117 SmartSwitch Push Wireless in the ELKO
Smart range (ELKO is a subsidiary of Schneider Electric).

### Troubleshooting

#### LED blinking green and red
Device is unable to communicate with gateway. Press the reset button quickly
three times, then hold for 20 seconds, until the LED blinks red. After this the
device will reboot and should be ready for pairing.

#### All buttons generates *_top actions
See the 1-channel vs 2-channel mode section above.

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
