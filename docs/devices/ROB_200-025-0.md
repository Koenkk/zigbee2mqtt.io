## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Set to `true` to simulate a `brightness` value (default: `false`).
If this device provides a `brightness_move_up` or `brightness_move_down` action it is possible to specify the update
interval and delta. This can be done by instead of specifying `true`:

```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```

## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on_1`, `off_1`, `brightness_move_up_1`, `brightness_move_down_1`, `brightness_stop_1`, `on_2`, `off_2`, `brightness_move_up_2`, `brightness_move_down_2`, `brightness_stop_2`, `on_3`, `off_3`, `brightness_move_up_3`, `brightness_move_down_3`, `brightness_stop_3`, `on_4`, `off_4`, `brightness_move_up_4`, `brightness_move_down_4`, `brightness_stop_4`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
