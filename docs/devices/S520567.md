It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Lift duration (numeric)
Duration of lift.
Value can be found in the published state on the `lift_duration` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `300`.
