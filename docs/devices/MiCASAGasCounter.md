>> ## Notes
Zigbee Gas Counter so it counts gas consumption from the counter directly and reports back the value to the coordinator.
The idea was to have a device counting without intervention of your server at home.
This is a DIY device so you have to checkout the documentation.
To use this device with Zigbee2MQTT a custom firmware has to be flashed which is explained [here](https://github.com/IgnacioHR/ZigbeeGasCounter) and build your own unit.
