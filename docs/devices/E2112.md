# Notes
## Device is not reporting with decimal points precision
[It's been reported by several people that this device does not report with decimal precision](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/17636).  
Even though the device has the option to set the number of digits after the decimal for both temperature and humidity, it does not report with decimals.
So unless IKEA chooses to fix this with a firmware update, this will not work.


## Pairing
Pair the sensor to Zigbee2MQTT by quickly pressing the pair button 4x to get it connected.

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `pm25_calibration`: Calibrates the pm25 value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.
