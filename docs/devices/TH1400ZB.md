## Notes


### Setting outdoor temperature
To set the *outdoor temperature* (value below the Out label on the thermostat display), you need to send the value to the following MQTT
topic:

```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: 'Publish outside temperature'
  description: 'Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats'
  mode: single
  trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.<OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_NAME>
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
      payload: "{{ states('sensor.<OUTDOOR_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_NAME>') }}"
```

### Setting outdoor temperature
To enable time you need to send a blank message to the following MQTT topic:

```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
```

*Every time the above message is sent, Zigbee2MQTT will calculate the current time and send it to the thermostat.*

If the thermostat loses power, you need to do this again. For Home Assistant users: if you want to avoid remembering to do this, you can
add the following `action` to your `Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temperature` automation (noted above).

``` yaml
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
      payload: ''
```
<!-- Notes END: Do not edit below this line -->



## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `thermostat_unit`: Controls the temperature unit of the thermostat (default celsius). The value must be one of `celsius`, `fahrenheit`
