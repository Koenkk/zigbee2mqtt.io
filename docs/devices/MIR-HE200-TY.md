## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Motion speed (numeric)
Speed of movement.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_speed` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Motion direction (enum)
direction of movement from the point of view of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_direction` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `standing_still`, `moving_forward`, `moving_backward`.

### Radar sensitivity (numeric)
Sensitivity of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radar_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"radar_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Radar scene (enum)
Presets for sensitivity for presence and movement.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radar_scene` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"radar_scene": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `default`, `area`, `toilet`, `bedroom`, `parlour`, `office`, `hotel`.

### Tumble switch (enum)
Tumble status switch.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tumble_switch` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"tumble_switch": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `ON`, `OFF`.

### Fall sensitivity (numeric)
Fall sensitivity of the radar.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fall_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fall_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Tumble alarm time (numeric)
Tumble alarm time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tumble_alarm_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"tumble_alarm_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`.
The unit of this value is `min`.

### Fall down status (enum)
Fall down status.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fall_down_status` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `maybe_fall`, `fall`.

### Static dwell alarm (text)
Static dwell alarm.
Value can be found in the published state on the `static_dwell_alarm` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
