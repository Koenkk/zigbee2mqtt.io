### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`, `color_hs`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.
- `color_hs`: To control the hue/saturation (color) publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"color": {"hue": HUE, "saturation": SATURATION}}` (e.g. `{"color":{"hue":360,"saturation":100}}`). To read the hue/saturation send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"color":{"hue":"","saturation":""}}`. Alternatively it is possible to set the hue/saturation via:
  - HSB space (hue, saturation, brightness): `{"color": {"h": H, "s": S, "b": B}}` e.g. `{"color":{"h":360,"s":100,"b":100}}` or `{"color": {"hsb": "H,S,B"}}` e.g. `{"color":{"hsb":"360,100,100"}}`
  - HSV space (hue, saturation, value):`{"color": {"h": H, "s": S, "v": V}}` e.g. `{"color":{"h":360,"s":100,"v":100}}` or `{"color": {"hsv": "H,S,V"}}` e.g. `{"color":{"hsv":"360,100,100"}}`
  - HSL space (hue, saturation, lightness)`{"color": {"h": H, "s": S, "l": L}}` e.g. `{"color":{"h":360,"s":100,"l":100}}` or `{"color": {"hsl": "H,S,L"}}` e.g. `{"color":{"hsl":"360,100,100"}}`

### White brightness (numeric)
White brightness of this light.
Value can be found in the published state on the `white_brightness` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"white_brightness": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `254`.
