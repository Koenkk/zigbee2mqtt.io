## Notes

### Pairing
Press the button inside the thermostat once. The LED will be lit 5 seconds green to confirm pairing. The LED will be lit 5 seconds red when pairing failed.
### Retract pin
Press the button inside the thermostat for 5 seconds (5 red blinks) to retract the pin, which is needed for mounting.
### Unpairing
Press the button inside the thermostat for 10 seconds (10 red blinks). 
### Calibration
Press the button inside the thermostat for 15 seconds (15 red blinks) to calibrate the movement (when mounted onto the radiator).
### Controlling the device
Controlling is done by setting the `valve_position`.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pi_heating_demand (numeric)
Position of the valve (= demanded heat) where 0% is fully closed and 100% is fully open.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pi_heating_demand` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"pi_heating_demand": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Local_temperature (numeric)
Current temperature measured on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `local_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Valve_position (numeric)
Directly control the radiator valve. The values range from 0 (valve closed) to 100 (valve fully open).
Value can be found in the published state on the `valve_position` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"valve_position": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"valve_position": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Force (enum)
How hard the motor pushes the valve. The closer to the boiler, the higher the force needed.
Value can be found in the published state on the `force` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"force": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"force": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `standard`, `high`, `very_high`.

### Radio_strength (enum)
Transmits with higher power when range is not sufficient.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radio_strength` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"radio_strength": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"radio_strength": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `normal`, `high`.

### Calibrate_valve (binary)
Calibrates valve on next wakeup.
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibrate_valve` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibrate_valve": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `calibrate` calibrate_valve is ON, if `idle` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
