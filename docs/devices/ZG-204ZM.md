## Notes

The manufacturer provides a good [technical in-depth document](https://doc.szalarm.com/zg-205Z/en/) that explains
what the various settings mean, good default values for those, a recommended method for trimming these values and 
various other considerations (like installation position) to get good results.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `large`, `small`, `static`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
