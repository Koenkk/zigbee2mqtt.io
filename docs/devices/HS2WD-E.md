## Notes


### Triggering the alarm
The alarm can be trigged by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` message
`{"warning": {"duration": 10, "mode": "emergency", "strobe": false}}`.

Where:
- `duration`: the number of seconds the alarm will be on (max is 1800 seconds)
- `mode`: `stop` or `emergency`
- `strobe`: `true` or `false` will let the strobe flash once during the alarm
        


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Warning (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"warning": {"mode": VALUE, "level": VALUE, "strobe_level": VALUE, "strobe": VALUE, "strobe_duty_cycle": VALUE, "duration": VALUE}}`
- `mode` (enum): Mode of the warning (sound effect). Allowed values: `stop`, `burglar`, `fire`, `emergency`, `police_panic`, `fire_panic`, `emergency_panic`
- `level` (enum): Sound level. Allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `strobe_level` (enum): Intensity of the strobe. Allowed values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`
- `strobe` (binary): Turn on/off the strobe (light) during warning. Allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `strobe_duty_cycle` (numeric): Length of the flash cycle. 
- `duration` (numeric): Duration in seconds of the alarm. 

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    state_class: "measurement"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    enabled_by_default: false
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    state_class: "measurement"
```
{% endraw %}
