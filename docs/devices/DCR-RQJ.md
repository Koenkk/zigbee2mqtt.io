## Exposes

### Gas (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected gas.
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` gas is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Gas value (numeric)
Measured gas concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `LEL %`.

### Carbon monoxide (binary)
Indicates if CO (carbon monoxide) is detected.
Value can be found in the published state on the `carbon_monoxide` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` carbon monoxide is ON, if `false` OFF.

### CO (numeric)
The measured CO (carbon monoxide) value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `co` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.
