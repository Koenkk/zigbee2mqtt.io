## Notes

### Calibration

Download the iOS or Android app from the
[device's website](https://www.shade-control.com/pages/simple-installation)
to calibrate the motor direction and low/high limits over bluetooth.

The app does not require registration or an account and after the initial
calibration the device can be used without it, over Zigbee.

### Pairing

Press the middle (stop) button for a few seconds until the led starts blinking
with blue color.

### Firmware upgrade

Can be done using the bluetooth app from the previous section.

### Reset

Press the middle (stop) button for about 5-10 seconds until the led changes
to red color.

### Factory reset

Perform a reset while the front cover of the device is removed.
