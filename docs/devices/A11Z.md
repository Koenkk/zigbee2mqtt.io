## Notes

### Pairing

**Press and hold the button for 7s** to put the device in pairing mode.  
The main LED will flash until it connects.

### Reset energy

To reset *Sum of consumed energy*, use the Dev console and execute:  
Endpoint: 1, Cluster: 0 (*genBasic*), Command: 0 (*resetFactDefault*), Payload: empty

Next time the plug reports attributes, *Sum of consumed energy* will start from zero again.

### Reset Child lock

Quickly press the physical button 4 times to reset *Child Lock* without Z2M. 

### Reporting

Configurable reporting works.  
- Each energy attribute is reported as often as configured
- However, it automatically reports all energy attributes every 5 mins, in addition to the configured interval
- Null values have a 10 second delay in Z2M to rule out invalid measurements

### Firmware

- Device comes with appVersion `82` (reported as v1.1.2 in Tuya app).  
- Subscribed to *manufactuerCode* `4417`, *imageType* `54179`

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `power_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for power, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for voltage, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for current, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `energy_calibration`: Calibrates the energy value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `energy_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for energy, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a maximum value of `3`

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a maximum value of `30`

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`
