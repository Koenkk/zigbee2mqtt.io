## Notes

### Pair the device

1. Enable 'Permit Join (All)'
2. Connect the device to power
3. Press the On/Off button in the center till the status LED blinks
4. Press 'S1' to pair the device

### Scenes

The 4 scenes can not be setup via the web-ui. They have to be setup on the wall dimmer itself.
For that bring all the lights into the desired configuration (on/off/brightness/color temp) and press the desired scene button (S1/S2/S3/S4) for a few seconds till the status LED blinks.
Short press the scene button to restore the scene.

### Central On/Off button

The central On/Off button turns on/off ALL connected devices! It is not group-aware!

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
