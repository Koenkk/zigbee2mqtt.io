## Notes

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature
  description: Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload: '{{ states(''sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor'') | string }}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
    service: mqtt.publish
```

### Activate eco mode
To set the eco_mode, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/1/set
```
Different version of ecoMode exist :
- **ecoMode** : off:-128, celsius*+-10, amount of setpoint reduction/increase for peak and pre-heating or 0 only for the eco icon to flash
- **ecoMode1** : 255=100%, range: 0-99 Set pi_heating_demand percentage limit 0% to 99% (225 = 100%)
- **EcoMode2** : off:255, range: 0-100, set heating restart if room temperature goes x% below setpoint

If you want to enable the eco mode using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'activate_eco_mode'
  alias: Activate-eco_mode
  description: Do stuff for the eco mode
  trigger: []
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload: '{"write":{"cluster":"manuSpecificSinope","options":{},"payload":{"ecoMode":<VALUE>}}}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/1/set
    service: mqtt.publish
```
