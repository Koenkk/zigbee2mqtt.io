## Notes


### Pin code usage
To retrieve the state, send a `get` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/get`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1}}`. To set, sent a `set` message to the device topic (`zigbee2mqtt/DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set`) with the body `{"pin_code":{"user":1,"pin_code":1234}}`. To clear a code, call `set` but omit the value for `pin_code`.
