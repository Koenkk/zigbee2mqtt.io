## Pairing
To initiate setup mode, press and hold the setup button on the rear of the device for +- 5 seconds until the setup light blinks red/green. It is now in pairing mode release the button. When paired, the light blinks orange (indicating tamper is triggered)

As with many HUE products pairing it to a HUE hub again and then removing it again also set's the device back to a initial pairing mode similar to a factory reset
