## Notes

### Pairing
To enter pairing mode, press the upper right button 3 times quickly. The LEDs will flash in orange. After a connection has been made, the LEDs will switch to green.

### Factory Reset
To reset the device, press the upper right button 3 times quickly (in less than 0.5 seconds) and then press and hold this button for at least 10 seconds. When the LEDs start
flashing red, release the button. If the reset is successful, the LEDs will flash in green a few times.
To change the connection mode from bluetooth to zigbee hold the button for 20 seconds instead of 10 seconds (red LED blinks faster)

### Mode change
It is possible to change from 1-gang to 2-gang.
To achieve this press the top left and bottom right button for 10 seconds (2 LEDs on the left and right start blinking).

To change to 1-gang a factory reset is needed.

### Battery
The device uses a single CR2032.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
