## Notes


### Pairing
For the OSRAM Smart+ Switch Mini (AC0251100NJ/AC0251600NJ/AC0251700NJ) hold the Middle and Arrow Down Buttons for 10 Seconds
to Reset the Device. Hold the Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to connect.
If the Switch is connected hold Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to disconnect.

### Known issue - pressing a button unexpectedly switches other Zigbee devices
This is referenced in [this issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/962). Problem occurs because of default bindings to group 0.

Known workaround is to create an empty group in Z2M with different ID (example: 1111), bind all three buttons to this group and remove default bindings to group 0.  
Read more on a similar issue and workarounds in [this issue](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/12397) related to other device.

### Actions
#### Arrow up 
causes 'on' at short pressure; 'brightness_move_up' at long pressure (>1 sec); 'brightness_stop' at long pressure release

#### Circle 
causes 'brightness_move_to_level' at short pressure; 'move_to_saturation' at long pressure (>1 sec); 'hue_stop' at long pressure release

#### Arrow down 
causes 'off' at short pressure; 'brightness_move_down' at long pressure (>1 sec); 'brightness_stop' at long pressure release

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `on`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_stop`, `color_temperature_move`, `hue_move`, `hue_stop`, `move_to_saturation`, `off`, `brightness_move_to_level`.
