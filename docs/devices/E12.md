Indicates if CO (carbon monoxide) is detected.
Value can be found in the published state on the `carbon_monoxide` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` carbon monoxide is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Carbon monoxide value (numeric)
Current CO concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `carbon_monoxide_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Self checking (binary)
Triggers self-checking process.
Value can be found in the published state on the `self_checking` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"self_checking": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"self_checking": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` self checking is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Checking result (enum)
Result of self-checking.
Value can be found in the published state on the `checking_result` property.

To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preheat": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` preheat is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Fault (binary)
Sensor fault indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fault` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"fault": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fault": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` fault is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Lifecycle (numeric)
Sensor service life or usage counter.
Value can be found in the published state on the `lifecycle` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
