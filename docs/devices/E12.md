or when the button is pressed, using custom Tuya commands.  
Otherwise, it doesn't send commands / spam.  
Bindings or reportings are not needed.

### Firmware

- Device comes with appVersion `80`

## Exposes

### Carbon monoxide (binary)
Indicates if CO level and exposure time are above safety limits, triggering the alarm.
Value can be found in the published state on the `carbon_monoxide` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` carbon monoxide is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Carbon monoxide value (numeric)
Current CO concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `carbon_monoxide_value` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Warming up (binary)
Sensor preheating status: Takes 120 to complete after power on.
Value can be found in the published state on the `warming_up` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` warming up is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Test device (enum)
Triggers the self-checking process: Beeps 4 times and takes 20 seconds to complete.
Value can be found in the published state on the `test` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"test": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `test`.

### Testing (binary)
Indicates if self-checking is currently running.
Value can be found in the published state on the `testing` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` testing is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Fault (binary)
Sensor fault indicator.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fault` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` fault is ON, if `false` OFF.

### End of life (binary)
Indicates whether the sensor is past its certified service life (10 years) and should be replaced.
Value can be found in the published state on the `end_of_life` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` end of life is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery state (enum)
State of the battery.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.
