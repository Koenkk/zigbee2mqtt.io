## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Power-on behavior (enum)
Controls the behavior when the device is powered on after power loss.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power_on_behavior` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power_on_behavior": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"power_on_behavior": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `off`, `on`, `toggle`, `previous`.

### Network indicator (binary)
Network indicator Settings, turn off/turn on the online network indicator..
Value can be found in the published state on the `network_indicator` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"network_indicator": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"network_indicator": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` network indicator is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Turbo mode (binary)
Enable/disable Radio power turbo mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `turbo_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"turbo_mode": ""}`.

If value equals `true` turbo mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Delayed power on state (binary)
Delayed Power-on State.
Value can be found in the published state on the `delayed_power_on_state` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"delayed_power_on_state": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"delayed_power_on_state": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` delayed power on state is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Delayed power on time (numeric)
Delayed Power-on time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `delayed_power_on_time` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"delayed_power_on_time": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"delayed_power_on_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0.5` and the maximum value is `3599.5`.
The unit of this value is `seconds`.

### Detach relay mode (binary)
Enable/Disable detach relay mode.

If value equals `true` detach relay mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### External trigger mode (enum)
External trigger mode, which can be one of edge, pulse, following(off), following(on). The appropriate triggering mode can be selected according to the type of external switch to achieve a better use experience..
