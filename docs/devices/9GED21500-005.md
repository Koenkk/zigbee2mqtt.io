## Notes
Pairing may be hindered by the lock attempting to join multiple times in succession, causing it to be kicked off the network after it joins. To work around this, pull the battery pack immediately after it joins. Upon powering up again, the device will remain on the network.

Because the PIN code is a numeric in the UI and not a string, it's not possible to set pin codes via UI that start with a zero (e.g. 0999 will be sent to the lock as 999). As a workaround, you can bypass the Z2M UI and publish an MQTT message manually as above with the pin code passed as a string.

year|week_day_schedule do not appear to be supported by this lock.

## Options

* `expose_pin`: Expose pin of this lock in the published payload (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "LOCK"}` or `{"state": "UNLOCK"}`.
To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
This lock exposes a lock state which can be found in the published state under the `lock_state` property. It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value. The possible values are: `not_fully_locked`, `locked`, `unlocked`.

### Pin code (composite)
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pin_code": {"user": VALUE, "user_type": VALUE, "user_enabled": VALUE, "pin_code": VALUE}}`
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"pin_code": ""}`.
- `user` (numeric): User ID to set or clear the pincode for 
- `user_type` (enum): Type of user, unrestricted: owner (default), (year|week)_day_schedule: user has ability to open lock based on specific time period, master: user has ability to both program and operate the door lock, non_access: user is recognized by the lock but does not have the ability to open the lock allowed values: `unrestricted`, `year_day_schedule`, `week_day_schedule`, `master`, `non_access`
- `user_enabled` (binary): Whether the user is enabled/disabled allowed values: `true` or `false`
- `pin_code` (numeric): Pincode to set, set pincode to null to clear 

### Action source name (enum)
Source of the triggered action on the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `action_source_name` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `keypad`, `rfid`, `manual`, `rf`.

### Action user (numeric)
ID of user that triggered the action on the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `action_user` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Auto relock time (numeric)
The number of seconds to wait after unlocking a lock before it automatically locks again. 0=disabled.
Value can be found in the published state on the `auto_relock_time` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"auto_relock_time": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"auto_relock_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `3600`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Sound volume (enum)
Sound volume of the lock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sound_volume` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sound_volume": ""}`.
