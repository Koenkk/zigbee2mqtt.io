## Notes


### Pairing
Plug the device in and wait for around 5mins, while it performs its self-tests.
A successful self-test is indicated by couple of beeps and a steady green led.
Now the device is ready for pairing. To initiate pairing quickly press the button three times in a row.


### Sensitivity
The sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
`{"sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITIVITY` is one of the following
values: `low`, `medium`,  `high`.

### Self-test
A self-test can be trigged by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
`{"selftest": ""}`.
If the selftest is executed successfully you will hear the device beep in 30 seconds.



## Exposes

### Gas (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected gas.
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` gas is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Sensitivity (enum)
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Gas_density (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `gas_density` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Selftest (enum)
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"selftest": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: ``.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
