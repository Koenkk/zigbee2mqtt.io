## Notes

### Important
These devices can only be used on channel 26.
These devices are locked to the manufacturer's network key (ext_pan_id).
Your configuration file [data/configuration.yaml](../guide/configuration/) must contain the following:

```yaml
advanced:
  ext_pan_id: [33,117,141,25,0,75,18,0]
  channel: 26
```

Therefore these devices may not co-existence with other Zigbee devices.
Maybe, you need to add a dedicated coordinator and create a new network for Livolo.
If you decided to create a new network, you should specify another 'pan_id'.

```yaml
advanced:
  pan_id: 6756
```

### Pairing
Press the buttons "down" and "settings" together for 3 seconds and it blinks red and blue in pairing mode.

## Exposes

### Cover 
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "OPEN"}`, `{"state": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Options (composite)
Motor options.
Can be set by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"options": {"motor_speed": VALUE, "motor_direction": VALUE}}`
- `motor_speed` (numeric): Motor speed min value is 20, max value is 40, unit is rpm
- `motor_direction` (enum): Motor direction allowed values: `FORWARD`, `REVERSE`

### Moving (binary)
Motor is moving.
Value can be found in the published state on the `moving` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` moving is ON, if `false` OFF.
