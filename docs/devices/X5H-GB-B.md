## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `running_state`, `preset`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `60`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `manual`, `program`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-9.9` and the maximum value is `9.9` with a step size of `0.1`.

### Sensor (enum)
Select temperature sensor to use.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensor` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensor": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `internal`, `external`, `both`.

### Schedule (text)
There are 8 periods in the schedule in total. 6 for workdays and 2 for holidays. It should be set in the following format for each of the periods: `hours:minutes/temperature`. All periods should be set at once and delimited by the space symbol. For example: `06:00/20.5 08:00/15 11:30/15 13:30/15 17:00/22 22:00/15 06:00/20 22:00/15`. The thermostat doesn't report the schedule by itself even if you change it manually from device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `schedule` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"schedule": NEW_VALUE}`.

### Child lock (binary)

Value can be found in the published state on the `child_lock` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `LOCK` child lock is ON, if `UNLOCK` OFF.

### Week (enum)
