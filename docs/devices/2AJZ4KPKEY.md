## Notes


### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```


### Pairing
Press and hold the reset button in the side of the device for +- 5 seconds (until the blue light starts blinking).
You will need a needle or a pin to do it. After this the device will automatically join.

### Important
Konke devices only work on Zigbee channel 15, 20 and 25.
