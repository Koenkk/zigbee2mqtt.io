## Notes

Occupancy indicated active movement. The attribute is not directly affected by the movement delay. But the movement delay will affect after what time the presence state is reset if only movement was detected but no presence.

Flip the factory reset to any state to restore factory settings. This will not reset zigbee settings only the sensor default values are loaded.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence. Will be true also when movement (occupancy) is detected..
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected movement. Will be true when movement. Can remain true even if the target left the detection range. In this case presence will be reset to false reliably..
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Closest target distance (numeric)
the target distance away from the sensor.
Value can be found in the published state on the `closest_target_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Movement timeout (numeric)
Timeout until the movement (occupancy) is reset when no further movement is detected. (Occupancy -> None).
Value can be found in the published state on the `movement_timeout` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"movement_timeout": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `43200`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Idle timeout (numeric)
Timeout until the presence is reset when no further presence is detected (Presence -> None).
Value can be found in the published state on the `idle_timeout` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"idle_timeout": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `43200`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

Value can be found in the published state on the `far_movement_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"far_movement_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Near movement sensitivity (numeric)
the moving detecting sensitivity  within 1 meter.
Value can be found in the published state on the `near_movement_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"near_movement_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `10`.
