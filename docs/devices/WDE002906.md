<!-- Notes BEGIN: You can edit here. Add "## Notes" headline if not already present. -->
## Pairing
Factory reset the wireless switch by tapping the top right button 3 times and hold it for 10 seconds after a fourth press (the LED in the center starts blinking red).
To change the connection mode from bluetooth to zigbee hold the button for 20 seconds instead of 10 seconds (red LED blinks faster)

To initiate pairing press the upper right button 3 times. 
When it starts blinking orange it is in the zigbee connection mode.
When it is blinking red and green it in the bluetooth connection mode.

## Mode change
It is possible to change from 1-gang and 2-gang.
To achieve this press the top left and bottom right button for 10 seconds (2 LEDs on the left and right start blinking).

To change to 1-gang a factory reset is needed.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
