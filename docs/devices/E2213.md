## Notes

### Printing Template
Template to print own covers is provided [here](https://github.com/thatslolo/IKEA-SOMRIG-template).

### Pairing
Pair the remote to Zigbee2MQTT by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the inside button 4 times.
The red light on the (front of the) remote will now flash a few times.

### Troubleshooting: Device didn't respond to OTA request
To resolve the `Device didn't respond to OTA request` error, you can try to push a button on it, shortly before you start the update, to wake up the Remote. Sometimes it also helps keeping the device awake, by pushing a button repeatedly until you read the first "Updating... 0.00%" message (about 5s).
