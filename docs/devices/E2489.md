[BILRESA scroll-wheel](./E2490.md)

### Battery
Uses 2 x AAA battery (rechargeable recommended)

This device *sleeps* to preserve energy when it's not actively used.  
When sleeping, it will not respond to any Z2M commands.  
**Press its buttons to keep it awake and allow interactions.**

### Pairing
You must go through this sequence to pair the remote:
1. Take off the faceplate / battery cover to find the pair button (middle)
2. **Hold the pair button for ~10s to factory reset the remote.** Red LED blinks while you hold.  
   Release when amber LED pulsates. Remote is now in Thread pairing mode
3. Move the remote away from other devices.  
   **Press the pair button 4 times to activate Touchlink.** Amber LED quickly blinks.  
   Remote is now trying to bind to nearby devices
4. **Press the pair button 8 times.** LEDs stay off!  
   Remote is now in Zigbee pairing mode

**It's important to pair this device through the coordinator!**  
Pairing through 'bad' routers (e.g. Telink Tuya, AwoX) might cause buttons not working.

A modern and updated coordinator may be required.

### Binding
Tested on model E2489, v1.8.5:  
**All remotes directly control group 21658.**
They can't be unbound / bound to anything else.

- Pairing inside the network is possible by adding target devices to group 21658.  
  - You must manually set up reporting for the target devices
  - Binds and unbinds appear successful, but they have no effect
  - Devices can be inside groups without Z2M knowing.  
    In Z2M UI, add them to the group first, so you can remove them afterwards
  
- Pairing outside the network is possible through [Touchlink](../guide/usage/touchlink.md)
  - Keep it very close to the target device (and power-off conflicting devices)
  - Activate Touchlink as described in [Pairing](#pairing). (No need to reset)
  - *Cloning* the remote is unknown / not possible (at least with older remotes)
  - If the remote is outside the network, activating Touchlink will:
    - Remove the target device from its network
    - Bind the devices
  - If both remote and target are inside the network, activating Touchlink will:
    - Add the target to group 21658 
    - Not remove it from other groups

### Action mapping

|                            Real Action |                                      Z2M Action |        Bind Action <br> (on group 21658) |
| -------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------: |
|                        Single press ON |                                            `on` |                                     *On* |
|                        Double press ON |                                     `on_double` |            *TradfriArrowSingle (256,13)* |
|                       Triple+ press ON |                                         nothing |                                  nothing |
|  Long press ON <br> *(hold + release)* |   `brightness_move_up` <br> + `brightness_stop` |   *Move (Up, 83)* <br> + *StopWithOnOff* |
|                       Single press OFF |                                           `off` |                                    *Off* |
|                       Double press OFF |                                    `off_double` |            *TradfriArrowSingle (257,13)* |
|                      Triple+ press OFF |                                         nothing |                                  nothing |
| Long press OFF <br> *(hold + release)* | `brightness_move_down` <br> + `brightness_stop` | *Move (Down, 83)* <br> + *StopWithOnOff* |

- **Commands are not sent instantly!**
  - There is a full 1s delay for every action.  
    (Needed to decide between single and double press)
  - It doesn't send any `initial_press` like the older [SOMRIG](./E2213.md) does
- **There is no way to achieve triple press** (or higher).  
  Remote doesn't send any message, so Z2M or automations can't detect it 

#### Scenes
The remote sends custom IKEA commands to cycle between scenes.  

Commands:
- *TradfriArrowSingle (256,13)* recalls next scene in group 65289
- *TradfriArrowSingle (257,13)* recalls previous scene in group 65289

Compatibility:
- IKEA WS Matter bulbs (2026) work and will create 8 scenes if there aren't any
  - Default scenes store only color temp: 0-5 neutral-cold, 6,7,0 neutral-warm
- IKEA WS bulbs on v3.x.x (2024) work, and will create 3 scenes if there aren't any  
  - Default scenes store only color temp: 0 neutral, 1 cold, 2 warm
- IKEA WS bulbs on v2.x.x (2019) work, but may need adding scenes manually
- IKEA WS bulbs on v1.x.x (201x) might not know the commands at all
- Other brands won't recognize the IKEA commands!

Add / Edit scenes:
1. Add IKEA bulbs to group 65289  
2. Create scenes in the group to overwrite them or add new ones

### Firmware
- Initial batches come with v1.8.5 (20250206) preinstalled
- Updates will be provided over Matter.  
  Move the device to a Thread hub to update
- See the available versions [here](https://webui.dcl.csa-iot.org/models)
  (search *BILRESA* or *4476*)

### Troubleshooting
1. Action reports N/A, difficulties pairing
   - Use a modern and updated coordinator
   - Power-off 'bad' routers (e.g. Telink Tuya, AwoX) and pair again
   - Pair directly through the coordinator
   - Add USB 2.0 extension to dongle coordinators
   - Use rechargable batteries
2. Action works, but battery reports N/A
   - Power-cycle the remote and refresh percentage
   - Otherwise same as 1
3. Device doesn't respond to Z2M requests
   - Press its buttons to wake it up

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a maximum value of `30`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```
