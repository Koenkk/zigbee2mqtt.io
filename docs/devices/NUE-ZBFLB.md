## Exposes

### Switch (button_light endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_button_light` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_button_light": "ON"}`, `{"state_button_light": "OFF"}` or `{"state_button_light": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_button_light": ""}`.

#### On with timed off
When setting the state to ON, it might be possible to specify an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time. To do this add an additional property `on_time` to the payload which is the time in seconds the state should remain on.
Additionally an `off_wait_time` property can be added to the payload to specify the cooldown time in seconds when the switch will not answer to other on with timed off commands.
Support depends on the switch firmware. Some devices might require both `on_time` and `off_wait_time` to work
Examples : `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300}`, `{"state" : "ON", "on_time": 300, "off_wait_time": 120}`.

### Switch (button_fan_high endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_button_fan_high` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_button_fan_high": "ON"}`, `{"state_button_fan_high": "OFF"}` or `{"state_button_fan_high": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_button_fan_high": ""}`.

### Switch (button_fan_med endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_button_fan_med` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_button_fan_med": "ON"}`, `{"state_button_fan_med": "OFF"}` or `{"state_button_fan_med": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state_button_fan_med": ""}`.

### Switch (button_fan_low endpoint)
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state_button_fan_low` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_button_fan_low": "ON"}`, `{"state_button_fan_low": "OFF"}` or `{"state_button_fan_low": "TOGGLE"}`.
