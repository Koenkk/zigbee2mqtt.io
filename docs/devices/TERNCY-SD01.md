### Pairing
Press and hold the knob on the device for 8 seconds (until the indicator blinks blue light 3 times) the indicator will continue blinking blue light if pairing is successful otherwise it will blink red light.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml

  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```
