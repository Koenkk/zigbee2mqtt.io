Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Human motion state (enum)
Human Motion State.
Value can be found in the published state on the `human_motion_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `small`, `large`.

### Departure delay (numeric)
Presence Time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `departure_delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"departure_delay": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `3` and the maximum value is `600`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Radar range (numeric)
Motion Range Detection.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radar_range` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"radar_range": NEW_VALUE}`.

The unit of this value is `cm`.

### Radar sensitivity (numeric)
Motion Detection Sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `radar_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"radar_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `7`.

### Presence sensitivity (numeric)
Motionless Detection Sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `7`.

### Current distance (numeric)
Current Distance of Detected Motion.
Value can be found in the published state on the `dis_current` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `1000`.
The unit of this value is `cm`.
