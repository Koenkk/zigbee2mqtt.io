## Notes

### Pairing

- Press and hold the `Mode` button to enter configuration mode
- If already paired with the Enki box, press and hold the `-` (minus) button until `Off` is displayed (you'll probably also have to first remove the heater from the Enki box using the dedicated app)
- Press and hold the `+` (plus) button until a code appears on the screen (this is a pairing code used with the Enki box app we don't use here)
- Turn on pairing mode in zigbee2mqtt
- Press (and sometimes hold) the `+` button until a "progress bar" appears on the screen 
- Wait for pairing. The device should show up in zigbee2mqtt in a few seconds and the screen should now display `On`
- Press and hold the `Mode` button to leave configuration mode (or wait for ~ 30 sec to 1 minute). The device should now display "Box" on the top right corner of the screen and the temperature setpoint

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `unoccupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `running_state`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `7` and `28`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`, `auto`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state": ""}`.
