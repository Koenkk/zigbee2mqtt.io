## Notes

### Troubleshooting
In case the sensor gets stuck and stops reporting (correct) data, you can try to restore it by following these steps:
  1. Force remove the device via the frontend.
  2. Restart Zigbee2MQTT.
  3. Re-pair the device.

### Battery
Uses a CR2450 battery

### Pairing
Long press the pairing button for five seconds. The signal indicator on the display will begin to blink when in pairing mode.

### Temperature display
Double click the pairing button to toggle the display between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This does not change the unit of the measured temperature value.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`
