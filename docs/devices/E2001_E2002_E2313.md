## Notes

### Battery
Uses 2 x AAA battery (rechargeable recommended)

This device *sleeps* to preserve energy when it's not actively used.  
When sleeping, it will not respond to any Z2M commands.  
**Press its buttons to keep it awake and allow interactions.**

### Pairing
**Press the pair button 4 times** to factory reset and start pairing.  
A red light should flash and pulsate until it connects.  
The button is found under the back cover, next to the battery.  

**It's important to pair this device through the coordinator!**  
Pairing through 'bad' routers (e.g. Telink Tuya, AwoX) might cause buttons not working.

### Binding
Tested on model E2313, version 2.4.17 (20240725):  
**The remote can directly control devices, but not groups.**  

- Controlling groups may be possible on older firmware versions

- **The remote spams the network and drains its battery if the bound device is offline!**  

- Pairing inside the network is possible by [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md): 
  - *OnOff* cluster for toggling 
  - *LevelCtrl* cluster for dimming
  - *Scenes* cluster for cycling scenes on IKEA devices, or recalling 1 scene on other devices
  
- Pairing outside the network is possible through [Touchlink](../guide/usage/touchlink.md)  
  - Keep it very close to the target device (and power-off conflicting devices).
  - **Hold the pair button for ~10s to activate.**  
    The red light will pulsate if the target responds
  - *Clone* the paired remote by keeping it close to another one, and activating Touchlink on both 
  - If the remote is outside the network, activating Touchlink will:
    - Remove the target device from its network
    - Bind the devices
  - If both remote and target are inside the network, activating Touchlink will:
    - Pick a random G (only the first time)
    - Remove the target device from all groups
    - Add the target to group G
    - Set the G parameter in *RecallScene (GroupId=G, SceneId=0)*
    - **Not** bind the remote to either device or group

Commands are sent instantly and there is no delay between clicks.  
ON/OFF buttons are heavily debounced and can't be double-pressed. 

#### Scenes
The remote sends custom IKEA commands to cycle between scenes.  
But the normal *RecallScene* in the long-press can be used by any device.

Commands:
- *TradfriArrowSingle (256,13)* recalls next scene in group 65289
- *TradfriArrowSingle (257,13)* recalls previous scene in group 65289
- *TradfriArrowHold (3328)* continuosly cycles scenes in group 65289 forward  
- *TradfriArrowHold (3329)* continuosly cycles scenes in group 65289 backward  
  (a few cycles, or until *TradfriArrowRelease*)

Compatibility:
- IKEA WS Matter bulbs (2026) work and will create 8 scenes if there aren't any
  - Default scenes store only color temp: 0-5 neutral-cold, 6,7,0 neutral-warm
- IKEA WS bulbs on v3.x.x (2024) work, and will create 3 scenes if there aren't any  
  - Default scenes store only color temp: 0 neutral, 1 cold, 2 warm
- IKEA WS bulbs on v2.x.x (2019) work, but may need adding scenes manually
- IKEA WS bulbs on v1.x.x (201x) might not know the commands at all
- Other brands won't recognize the IKEA commands, but they will respond to 
  *On* and *RecallScene (G,0)*

Add / Edit scenes:
  - For IKEA commands, add the bulbs to group 65289.  
    Create scenes in the group to overwrite them or add new ones
  - For other brands, use Touchlink to generate the group number G.  
    Use debug logs to see the number G.  
    Add the devices to group G and create scene 0 in group G

### Firmware
- Latest batches come with v2.4.17 preinstalled, documented above
- Latest available on Z2M is v2.4.16 - no differences found
- Older firmware might support group binding
- Older firmware might not support cycling scenes
- IKEA changed the firmware versioning after the original 1.0.0.24
  - That gives the error "Firmware on ... is newer than latest firmware online",  
  despite the online firmware being actually newer
  - Follow the instructions in [this issue] to force update the firmware

### Troubleshooting
1. Action reports N/A, difficulties pairing
    - Update coordinator
    - Power-off 'bad' routers (e.g. Telink Tuya, AwoX) and pair again
    - Pair directly through the coordinator
    - Add USB 2.0 extension to dongle coordinators
    - Use rechargable batteries
2. Action works, but battery reports N/A
    - Power-cycle the remote and refresh percentage
    - Otherwise same as 1
3. Battery drains too quick
    - Reset or unbind it from offline devices
4. Missing *Scenes* cluster
    - Update, interview, reconfigure

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `identify_timeout`: Sets the duration of the identification procedure in seconds (i.e., how long the device would flash).The value ranges from 1 to 30 seconds (default: 3). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1` and with a maximum value of `30`

* `simulated_brightness`: Simulate a brightness value. If this device provides a brightness_move_up or brightness_move_down action it is possible to specify the update interval and delta. The action_brightness_delta indicates the delta for each interval. Example:
```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```

It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.
