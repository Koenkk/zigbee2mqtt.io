## Notes


### Pairing
It's recommend to first pair the included TRADFRI signal repeater in the room where you want to put the blinds.
Now press both buttons on the blind (next to battery lid) for 5 seconds until a white light between both buttons is turned on.
The device is now awake and ready to pair for 2 minutes.
After that pair the blind by holding the blind battery lid very close to the TRADFRI signal repeater until the white light is turned off (this should mean the pairing is successful).

### End Position
The roller blind maximum extension can be set by moving the blind to the desired position and then double pressing the up or down button.
To reset the end position so you can define a newer more extended end position, open the blind fully. Then double press the up or down button. You can now set the blind extension again.
