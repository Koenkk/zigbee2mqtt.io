To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.

To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pi_heating_demand": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the % between `0` and `100`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.

- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.

### Occupied heating setpoint scheduled (numeric)
Scheduled change of the setpoint. Alternative method for changing the setpoint. In the opposite to occupied_heating_setpoint it does not trigger an aggressive response from the actuator. (more suitable for scheduled changes).
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupied_heating_setpoint_scheduled` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint_scheduled": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint_scheduled": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### External measured room sensor (numeric)
The temperature sensor of the TRV is — due to its design — relatively close to the heat source (i.e. the hot water in the radiator). Thus there are situations where the `local_temperature` measured by the TRV is not accurate enough: If the radiator is covered behind curtains or furniture, if the room is rather big, or if the radiator itself is big and the flow temperature is high, then the temperature in the room may easily diverge from the `local_temperature` measured by the TRV by 5°C to 8°C. In this case you might choose to use an external room sensor and send the measured value of the external room sensor to the `External_measured_room_sensor` property. The way the TRV operates on the `External_measured_room_sensor` depends on the setting of the `Radiator_covered` property: If `Radiator_covered` is `false` (Auto Offset Mode): You *must* set the `External_measured_room_sensor` property *at least* every 3 hours. After 3 hours the TRV disables this function and resets the value of the `External_measured_room_sensor` property to -8000 (disabled). You *should* set the `External_measured_room_sensor` property *at most* every 30 minutes or every 0.1°C change in measured room temperature. If `Radiator_covered` is `true` (Room Sensor Mode): You *must* set the `External_measured_room_sensor` property *at least* every 30 minutes. After 35 minutes the TRV disables this function and resets the value of the `External_measured_room_sensor` property to -8000 (disabled). You *should* set the `External_measured_room_sensor` property *at most* every 5 minutes or every 0.1°C change in measured room temperature. The unit of this value is 0.01 `°C` (so e.g. 21°C would be represented as 2100)..
Value can be found in the published state on the `external_measured_room_sensor` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"external_measured_room_sensor": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"external_measured_room_sensor": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `-8000` and the maximum value is `3500`.

### Radiator covered (binary)
Controls whether the TRV should solely rely on an external room sensor or operate in offset mode. `false` = Auto Offset Mode (use this e.g. for exposed radiators) or `true` = Room Sensor Mode (use this e.g. for covered radiators). Please note that this flag only controls how the TRV operates on the value of `External_measured_room_sensor`; only setting this flag without setting the `External_measured_room_sensor` has no (noticeable?) effect..
Value can be found in the published state on the `radiator_covered` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"radiator_covered": ""}`.
