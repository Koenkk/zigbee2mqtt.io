## Notes
### Warning!

The device has a potentially deathly flaw.
The mains power supply is based on a simple buck converter 
where neutral of the mains input is referencing GND on the sensor connector.

This device should only be powered by an isolated power supply via the micro-USB port.

### Temperature and Humidity sensing

The device comes in bundles with what looks like a DHT-22
and a DS18B20 style temperature probe is also offered in a bundle.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `state_action`: State actions will also be published as 'action' when true (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`
