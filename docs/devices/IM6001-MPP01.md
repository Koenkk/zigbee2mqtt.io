## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. This option can only decrease the precision, not increase it. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`


## Exposes

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.

Value can be found in the published state on the `moving` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` moving is ON, if `false` OFF.

### X axis (numeric)
Accelerometer X value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `x_axis` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Y axis (numeric)
Accelerometer Y value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `y_axis` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Z axis (numeric)
Accelerometer Z value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `z_axis` property.
