## Notes

### Pairing
To pair this device you have to install the device via its installation code. The installation code can be obtained by scanning the QR-code on the device with your smartphone. Then get the device into pairing mode. In zigbee2mqtt navigate to  "Settings" --> "Tools" and click on "Add install code". Paste the code you got from the QR-code and confirm by clicking "OK" which will get zigbee2mqtt into pairing mode automatically. Wait for your device to be joined.

### Configuration
The device can operate either as a two-channel light switch or as roller shutter/window blind. After pairing, the device mode is initially set to 'disabled' and will not accept any switching or open/close commands. The device mode must be set to 'light' or 'shutter' via the frontend or by publishing `{"device_mode": "shutter"}` or `{"device_mode": "light"}` to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`.

### Factory reset
To reset the device to factory settings, press and hold the device's main button on the front until the device's LED starts flashing. Release the main button and press and hold it again until the device's LED is lighting up green. The device will then restart and look for a Zigbee network to join. In case something went wrong, the device's LED will flash red.
