## Notes

### Pairing
Press the reset Button for ten seconds to reset the device - the red LED flashes one time confirming the reset. Then short the pins of input one.  
The red LED begins to flash every two seconds indicating pairing mode.

### Directly control Zigbee groups
It's possible to configure this switch to directly control Zigbee groups. In this way the switch can control e.g. a group of light bulbs even when Zigbee2MQTT is not running. To accomplish this:
1. In the Zigbee2MQTT frontend go to the switch -> *Bind* tab. Uncheck **all** clusters **except** `manuSpecificPhilips` (so only `manuSpecificPhilips` is checked) and click *Unbind* in the row where destination is `Coordinator`. If this fails, wake-up the switch by triggering it and try again.
1. Go to the *Logs* tab and trigger the switch, this will log the group ID which this switch controls:
    ```
    MQTT publish: topic 'zigbee2mqtt/0x001788010cc53971', payload '{"action":"toggle","action_group":16606,"battery":100,"linkquality":110}'
    ```
    The group ID in this example is `16606`.
1. Go to the *Groups* tab and create a new group with the ID from the previous step. Add devices to the groups which you like to be controlled by this switch.

Notes:
- This device does not support direct binding (to a device instead of a group) and you cannot change the group ID it controls.
- After doing this, no actions will be send to the coordinator anymore. To revert this (and stop the switch from directly controlling the group), press the yellow reconfigure button in the *About* tab.
- Actions are only send for input 1 of the device, for input 2 no actions will be send (so a double rocker is **not** supported).
