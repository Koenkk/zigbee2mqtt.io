## Notes


Device can learn IR codes and send already known IR codes.

### Control
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` various device attributes can control the device:

#### Switch to a learning mode

Request:
```json
{
    "learn_ir_code":"ON"
}
```

The command activates the orange light on the device. You have several seconds to take source IR remote, move it closer to the device and press a button. The learned IR code will be exposed as `learned_ir_code`.

#### Send already learned IR code

Request:
```json
{
    "ir_code_to_send": "<previously learned IR code>"
}
```

### Pairing
Open the back and press the reset button until the LED on the front start blinking.

## Exposes

### Learn ir code (binary)
Turn on to learn new IR code.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"learn_ir_code": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` learn ir code is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Learned ir code (text)
The IR code learned by device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `learned_ir_code` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Ir code to send (text)
The IR code to send by device.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"ir_code_to_send": NEW_VALUE}`.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %, can take up to 24 hours before reported.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Voltage of the battery in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mV`.
