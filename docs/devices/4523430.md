<!-- Notes BEGIN: You can edit here. Add "## Notes" headline if not already present. -->
## Notes
This device does not seem to support Zigbee channels higher than channel 15. If your network uses a higher Zigbee channel, you might not be able to join this device to the network.

### Pairing
* Press "arrow up" and "M" simultaneously until "joining" and "pairing" is shown on the ELKO Super TR RF display.
<!-- Notes END: Do not edit below this line -->



## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `thermostat_unit`: Controls the temperature unit of the thermostat (default celsius). The value must be one of `celsius`, `fahrenheit`

* `local_temperature_based_on_sensor`: Base local temperature on sensor choice (default false). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `running_state`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `50`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state": ""}`.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to add/subtract to the local temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`The minimal value is `-12.8` and the maximum value is `12.7` with a step size of `0.1`.

### Display text (text)
Displayed text on thermostat display (zone). Max 14 characters.
Value can be found in the published state on the `display_text` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"display_text": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"display_text": NEW_VALUE}`.

### Load (numeric)
Load in W when heating is on (between 0-2300 W). The thermostat uses the value as input to the mean_power calculation..
Value can be found in the published state on the `load` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"load": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"load": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `2300`.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Regulator mode (binary)
Device in regulator or thermostat mode..
Value can be found in the published state on the `regulator_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"regulator_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"regulator_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `regulator` regulator mode is ON, if `thermostat` OFF.

### Regulator time (numeric)
When device is in regulator mode this controls the time between each in/out connection. When device is in thermostat mode this controls the  time between each in/out switch when measured temperature is within +-0.5 °C set temperature. Choose a long time for (slow) concrete floors and a short time for (quick) wooden floors..
Value can be found in the published state on the `regulator_time` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"regulator_time": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"regulator_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `5` and the maximum value is `20`.
The unit of this value is `min`.

### Sensor (enum)

### Floor temp (numeric)
Current temperature measured on the external sensor (floor).
Value can be found in the published state on the `floor_temp` property.

Value can be found in the published state on the `max_floor_temp` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"max_floor_temp": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_floor_temp": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `20` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Mean power (numeric)
Reports average power usage last 10 minutes.
Value can be found in the published state on the `mean_power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"mean_power": ""}`.
