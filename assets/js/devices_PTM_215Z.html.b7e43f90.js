Messages from Green Power devices cannot be &quot;understood&quot; by normal Zigbee devices, therefore they need to be &quot;translated&quot; first. Not all Zigbee devices can do this translation. The devices known to do this are Philips Hue devices and some Ikea Tradfri bulbs (for example <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/LED2107C4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED2107C4</a> is confirmed to work). This means that the Green Power device has to be in range of one of these devices in order to use it.</p><p>Green Power devices don&#39;t support binding and are not included in network scans.</p><h3 id="pairing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pairing"><span>Pairing</span></a></h3><p>Before starting a pairing attempt, please read carefully this section from the <strong><a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/zigbee/01_zigbee_network.html#green-power-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation </a></strong>. Additionally, it&#39;s important to know which channel your Zigbee network is using (the default is 11). You can find this in the Zigbee2MQTT frontend under <code>Settings &gt; Advanced</code>, or <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/zigbee-network.html#changing-the-zigbee-channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn more about changing the channel</a>.</p><p>This device has 4 buttons:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Number</th><th>Button</th><th>Position</th><th>Channel</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>A0</td><td>Top left</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>A1</td><td>Bottom left</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>B0</td><td>Top right</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>B1</td><td>Bottom right</td><td>25</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In case the module is integrated in a single rocker switch, you need to remove the caps to expose all buttons. A button can be pressed by holding the contact of that button and then push the energy bar.</p><p>To pair it, hold the corresponding button for the channel of your network for 7 seconds or more.</p><p>Once the device is paired you need to confirm the channel. To do this press A1 and B0 together. Important: don&#39;t press any other buttons between this and the pairing.</p><p>In case you want to pair it to a different channel you have to factory reset the device. This can be done by pressing all buttons (A0, A1, B0 and B1) simultaneously for at least 7 seconds (long press).</p><p>Alternatively, you should be able to reset the switch with the following pattern:</p><ol><li>Press top left (A0)</li><li>Press and hold top right (B0) for about 10 seconds</li><li>press top right (B0) and bottom left (A1) at the same time</li><li>press top left (A0) Note: Please make sure the module is positioned the right way up.</li></ol><h3 id="disabling-commissioning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#disabling-commissioning"><span>Disabling commissioning</span></a></h3><p>Whenever a radio channel is selected in accordance to the above paragraph, PTM 215Z devices will issue a “Join” request if a button is hold more than 7 seconds (long press).
