This is especially handy for e.g. Philips Hue bulbs as they cannot be factory reset by turning them on/off 5 times. Demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcRj77YGyKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a></p><p>To factory reset a device through Touchlink bring the device close (&lt; 10 cm) to your Zigbee Coordinator (e.g. Zigbee USB adapter). After this send a MQTT message to <code>zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/touchlink/factory_reset</code> with an empty payload.</p><p>Zigbee2MQTT will now start scanning, this can take up to 1 minute and during this scan <strong>your network cannot be used</strong>. After some time the device will identify itself (e.g. a bulb will start to blink).</p><p>Now that your device has been factory reset, it will automatically join Zigbee2MQTT (make sure that joining is enabled). If it doesn&#39;t, try powering the bulb off and on 1 time.</p><p>In case you want to factory reset a specific device (which can be found through a scan, see above) request the factory reset with the following payload: <code>{&quot;ieee_address&quot;: &quot;0x12345678&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;: 12}</code>.</p>',15)])])}]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/guide/usage/touchlink.html","title":"Touchlink","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"pageClass":"content-page"},"git":{"updatedTime":1762029806000,"contributors":[{"name":"Koen Kanters","username":"","email":"koenkanters94@gmail.com","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"65fac821d7d53a7e50cd38541621bbb5ac5d9dd0","time":1762029806000,"email":"koenkanters94@gmail.com","author":"Koen Kanters","message":"Update zhc to 25.59.0"}]},"filePathRelative":"guide/usage/touchlink.md"}')}}]);
