If you want to move a Zigbee device to a different Zigbee network then you need to factory reset that Zigbee device and re-pair/re-join it to the other Zigbee Gateway. This is a limitation in the current (as well as previous) Zigbee protocol specifications, governed by the <a href="https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance)</a>, and as such, that limitation applies to all Zigbee implementations, not just the Zigbee2MQTT implementation.</p><p>Another limitation that applies to all Zigbee implementations is that there is no such thing as &quot;Zigbee over IP&quot; or &quot;Zigbee over LAN/WAN&quot; in the Zigbee protocol specifications. It is therefore not possible to extend the same Zigbee network to two separate locations or sites that can not be reached directly via Zigbee radio signals within the Zigbee network mesh. That means that there is no way to use a so-called &quot;Zigbee network adapter&quot; or similar solutions to convert and bridge a single Zigbee network communication over a different medium such as Ethernet or VPN. As such there are no network-attached remote Zigbee adapters that can span a Zigbee network to remote sites, regardless if the marketing material of such products makes it sound like they can do in &quot;Zigbee Router&quot; mode. The fact is that the &quot;Zigbee Router&quot; feature of such &quot;Zigbee network adapter&quot; products puts their Zigbee radio chip into stand-alone mode so it works like any Zigbee Router device, disconnected from the Ethernet network part in those products.</p><p>Support for commissioning Zigbee 3.0 devices via &quot;Install Code&quot; or &quot;QR Code&quot; has so far only been implemented for &#39;zstack&#39; (Texas Instruments ZNP) and &#39;ember&#39; (Silicon Labs EmberZNet) adapter type radios in Zigbee2MQTT.

The exact method these values are reported depends on the Zigbee network stack used on each device. LQI values can be modified at each step as the message propagates through the mesh networking matrix.</p><p>Interpreting RSSI and LQI values is complex. Unless you are a Zigbee specialist yourself or are guided by one, please ignore those values. They can be misleading. If you delve into this, it is important to understand not to judge RSSI or LQI values on their own. When troubleshooting Zigbee messages that are being dropped, you must interpret the combination of both RSSI and LQI.</p><p>RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values are an indicator value of the raw signal strength between two devices. RSSI values are negative numbers in -dBm format (0 to -100 power ratio in decibels of the measured power referenced to one milliwatt). Lower negative values indicate less interference and a good signal. RSSI information is only between the endpoint device and the first hop from that device. As such, it may not necessarily show signal strength to the Zigbee Coordinator but instead could be showing signal strength to the nearest Zigbee Router device.</p><ul><li>Generally, anything -60 and above (meaning -50, -40, etc.) in RSSI should be considered a strong signal (not losing messages).</li><li>Anything at -80 and below (meaning -85, -90, etc.) in RSSI should be considered a noisy environment and you risk losing messages.</li></ul><p>LQI (Link Quality Index) values can be hard to interpret for Zigbee. This is because the Zigbee specifications and the (IEEE 802.15.4 specification) do not standardize how to perform LQI measurements. LQI values are shown as positive numbers on a scale. But because the value provided by the Zigbee devices is not measured using unified standards from all device manufacturers and Zigbee stacks, the values can not always be trusted. For example, Zigbee devices based on Silicon Labs EmberZNet stack use positive display numbers for LQI, where higher is better and lower is worse. The Texas Instruments Z-Stack computes LQI for each received packet from the raw “received signal strength index” (RSSI) by linearly scaling it between the minimum and maximum defined RF power levels for the radio that more or less just provides an LQI value that, based on the strength of the received signal. This can be misleading in case the user has a noisy environment with interference within the same frequency range (as the RSSI value may be shown as increased even though the true link quality decreases). Other manufacturers and Zigbee stacks measure and calculate LQI values in another way.</p><ul><li>In theory, an LQI value of 255 means a zero error rate, meaning it indicates absolute perfect link quality.</li><li>In general, a positive high LQI value is better and a lower LQI value is worse. However, depending on your devices, that might not be the reality.</li><li>Usually, if a device stays at an LQI value of 40+ or above then that link can usually be considered acceptable for normal operational conditions.</li></ul><h2 id="why-is-the-action-property-always-empty" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-the-action-property-always-empty"><span>Why is the <code>action</code> property always empty?</span></a></h2><p>When the Home Assistant legacy action sensor is enabled (<code>homeassistant.legacy_action_sensor: true</code> in your <code>configuration.yaml</code>) the <code>action</code> property of your e.g. buttons will almost always be empty.
